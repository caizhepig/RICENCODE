## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers
2. __seedling__, [Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers, Our result showed that mRNA levels of rice Hmg2 were strongly induced in seedlings and influorescence in the early development stage
