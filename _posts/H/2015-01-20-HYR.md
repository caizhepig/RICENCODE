5. __HIGHER YIELD RICE__, [Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.%5BTitle%5D)), To study the regulation of photosynthesis, we developed a rice gene regulatory network and identified a transcription factor HYR (HIGHER YIELD RICE) associated with PCM, which on expression in rice enhances photosynthesis under multiple environmental conditions, determining a morpho-physiological programme leading to higher grain yield under normal, drought and high-temperature stress conditions.
