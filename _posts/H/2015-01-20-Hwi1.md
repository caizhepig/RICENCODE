1. __crown__, [Genetic and physiological analysis of a novel type of interspecific hybrid weakness in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic and physiological analysis of a novel type of interspecific hybrid weakness in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The dominant Hybrid weakness i1 (Hwi1) gene from wild rice is genetically incompatible with Teqing and induced a set of weakness symptoms, including growth suppression, yield decrease, impaired nutrient absorption, and the retardation of crown root initiation
