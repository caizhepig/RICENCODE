## Expression information

## Key message
1. __culm__, [Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
2. __root__, [Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
3. __chloroplast__, [Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on sequence comparison and molecular analysis, we propose that the chloroplast-located TPI may be encoded by divergent structural nuclear genes in rice
4. __leaf__, [Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
