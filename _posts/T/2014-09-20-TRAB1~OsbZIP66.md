## Key message
1. __dormancy__, [A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription%5BTitle%5D)),  Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos
2. __ ABA __, [Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1%5BTitle%5D)), The rice basic domain/Leu zipper factor TRAB1 binds to abscisic acid (ABA) response elements and mediates ABA signals to activate transcription, We had shown previously that a chimeric promoter containing GAL4 binding sites became ABA inducible when a GAL4 binding domain-TRAB1 fusion protein was present, This expression system allowed us to assay the ABA response function of TRAB1, Our results suggest that the terminal or nearly terminal event of the primary ABA signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation in the nucleus of preexisting TRAB1

## Connection
1. __OSVP1,VP1__, __TRAB1,OsbZIP66__, [A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription%5BTitle%5D)),  Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs, Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos,A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription
