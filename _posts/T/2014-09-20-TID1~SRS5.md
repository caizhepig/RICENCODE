## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our analysis of the Tid1-1 mutant revealed that the dynamics of microtubules affects not only anisotropic growth in both dicots and monocots, but also meristematic activity and gross plant morphology
2. __growth__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report a dominant mutant, Twisted dwarf 1-1 (Tid1-1), showing dwarfism and twisted growth in rice, Tid1-1 exhibit right helical growth of the leaves and stem and shortening of the roots, Our analysis of the Tid1-1 mutant revealed that the dynamics of microtubules affects not only anisotropic growth in both dicots and monocots, but also meristematic activity and gross plant morphology
3. __root__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Tid1-1 exhibit right helical growth of the leaves and stem and shortening of the roots
4. __brassinosteroid__, [Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These data indicate that SRS5 independently regulates cell elongation of the brassinosteroid signal transduction pathway
5. __stem__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Tid1-1 exhibit right helical growth of the leaves and stem and shortening of the roots, Our analysis of the Tid1-1 mutant revealed that the dynamics of microtubules affects not only anisotropic growth in both dicots and monocots, but also meristematic activity and gross plant morphology
6. __seed__, [Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report a novel semi-dominant mutant Small and round seed 5 (Srs5) that encodes alpha-tubulin protein, Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2
7. __lemma__, [Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Lemma cell length was reduced in Srs5 compared with that of the wild-type
8. __cell elongation__, [Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These data indicate that SRS5 independently regulates cell elongation of the brassinosteroid signal transduction pathway
9. __dwarf__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report a dominant mutant, Twisted dwarf 1-1 (Tid1-1), showing dwarfism and twisted growth in rice
10. __cell division__, [A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an α-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Cells in the leaves of Tid1-1 are often ill-shapen, possibly owing to irregular cell division

## Connection
1. __D61~OsBRI1__, __TID1~SRS5__, [Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2, Furthermore, SRS5 and BRI1 genes were highly expressed in Srs5 and d61-2 mutants
