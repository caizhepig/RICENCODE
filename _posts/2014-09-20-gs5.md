## Key message
1. grain width, [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural%20variation%20in%20GS5%20plays%20an%20important%20role%20in%20regulating%20grain%20size%20and%20yield%20in%20rice%5BTitle%5D)), We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight
2. grain size, [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural%20variation%20in%20GS5%20plays%20an%20important%20role%20in%20regulating%20grain%20size%20and%20yield%20in%20rice%5BTitle%5D)), We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight| GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size| The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2)|Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice
