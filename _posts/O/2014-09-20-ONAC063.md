## Key message
1. __salinity__, [Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), " ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots, The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure, Microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed upregulated expression of some salinity-inducible genes, including the amylase gene AMY1, in ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis, Thus, ONAC063 may play an important role in eliciting responses to high-salinity stress"
2. __seed__, [Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure
