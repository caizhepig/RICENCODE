## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHk4 recognized trans-zeatin (tZ) and iP, while OsHk3 scarcely induced cytokinin signaling activity
