## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor
2. __grain__, [Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHk4 and OsHk6 were highly expressed in spikelets, suggesting that tZ and iP might play key roles in grain development
3. __cytokinin__, [Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHk6 was highly sensitive to isopentenyladenine (iP) and was capable of restoring cytokinin-dependent ARR6 reporter expression in the ahk2 ahk3 Arabidopsis mutant upon treatment with 1 nM iP, Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor,Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP
