## Key message
1. __seed__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
2. __grain__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
3. __salt__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses
4. __yield__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
5. __drought__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses, The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected, Taken together, these data indicate that OCPI1 might potentially be useful in the genetic improvement of drought resistance in rice"

9. __growth__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
