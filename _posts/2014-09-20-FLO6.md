## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) gene in rice, Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation
2. __seed__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds
3. __starch__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed, Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly, We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds
