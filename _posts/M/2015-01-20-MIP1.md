## Key message
1. __height__, [Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1%5BTitle%5D)),  The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height
2. __tillering__, [Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1%5BTitle%5D)),  The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height, In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
3. __tiller__, [Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1%5BTitle%5D)),  The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height, In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering

## Connection
1. __MIP1__, __MOC1__, [Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we reported that MIP1 interacted with MOC1 both in vitro and in vivo, In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
