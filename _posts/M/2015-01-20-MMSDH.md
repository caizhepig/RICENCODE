## Key message
1. __gibberellin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin, Furthermore, the amount of MMSDH in slr1, a constitutive gibberellin response mutant, was 2-fold that of wild type
2. __leaf__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
3. __sheath__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
4. __auxin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Of these seven, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) was elevated by treatment with auxin alone, MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin, MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period, These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
5. __cytokinin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin
6. __root__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades, MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period, These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
7. __zinc__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period, These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
