## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Map-based cloning revealed that WSL encodes a newly identified rice PPR protein which targets the chloroplasts.
2. __ABA__, [A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H2O2 than wild-type. 
3. __salinity__, [A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H2O2 than wild-type. 
4. __sugar__, [A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H2O2 than wild-type. 
5. __abiotic stress__, [A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice
