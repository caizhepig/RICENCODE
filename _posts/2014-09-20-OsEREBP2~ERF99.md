## Key message
1. __drought__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)), " On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses"
2. __salt tolerance__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
3. __salinity__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)), " On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses"
4. __abiotic stress__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)), " On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses"
5. __transcription factor__, [OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors%5BTitle%5D)),  Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
6. __salt__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
