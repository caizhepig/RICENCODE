## Key message
1. __tiller number__, [Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development%5BTitle%5D)),  Yield-related agronomic traits, including flowering time and effective tiller number, were altered in osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
2. __growth__, [Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development%5BTitle%5D)),  The osctr2 loss-of-function mutation and expression of the 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgene that encodes the OsCTR2 N terminus (residues 1-513) revealed several and many aspects, respectively, of ethylene-induced growth alteration in rice, Because the osctr2 allele did not produce all aspects of ethylene-induced growth alteration, the ethylene-receptor signal output might be mediated in part by OsCTR2 and by other components in rice, Our understanding of roles of ethylene in various aspects of growth and development in japonica rice varieties could be advanced with the use of the osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
