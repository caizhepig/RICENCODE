## Key message
1. __seed__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1
2. __endosperm__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1

## Connection
1. __IRE1,OsIRE1__, __OsBiP4__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice, In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment, Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice
