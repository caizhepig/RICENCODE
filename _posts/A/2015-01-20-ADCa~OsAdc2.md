## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas OsAdc1 is expressed in leaf, root and stem, OsAdc2 expression is restricted to stem tissue
2. __stem__, [Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas OsAdc1 is expressed in leaf, root and stem, OsAdc2 expression is restricted to stem tissue
3. __root__, [Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas OsAdc1 is expressed in leaf, root and stem, OsAdc2 expression is restricted to stem tissue
