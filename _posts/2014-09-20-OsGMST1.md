## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice, OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice
2. __salt__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice, OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice,Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)
3. __transporter__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, reversed genetics was used to identify OsGMST1 as a member of the monosaccharide transporter family in rice, The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST1 expression,Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)
