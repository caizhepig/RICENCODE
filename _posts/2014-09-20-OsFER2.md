## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
2. __iron__, [Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)%5BTitle%5D)),  Exposure to copper, Paraquat, SNP and excess iron led to accumulation of ferritin mRNA, remarkably of OsFER2
3. __reproductive__, [Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels

## Connection
1. __OsFER1__, __OsFER2__, [Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)%5BTitle%5D)),  Using a strategy based in amplicon size difference, we were able to analyze the expression profile of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2), OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels,Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)
