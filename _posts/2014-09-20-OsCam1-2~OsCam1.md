## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsCam1-2,OsCam1__, __OsCam2__, [Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D)),  Complementary DNA for each of the calmodulin genes, OsCam1, OsCam2, and OsCam3 were sequenced, OsCam1 and OsCam2 encode a conventional 148-amino acid calmodulin protein that contains four characteristic Ca(2+)-binding motifs
