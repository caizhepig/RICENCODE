## Connection
1. __COPT1__, __COPT5__, [Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport, Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5
