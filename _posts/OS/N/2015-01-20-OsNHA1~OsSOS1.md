## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice transporter, denoted by OsSOS1, demonstrated a capacity for Na+/H+ exchange in plasma membrane vesicles of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and reduced their net cellular Na+ content
2. __salt__, [Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress"
3. __seedling__, [Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
4. __leaf__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells
5. __salt__, [Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Moreover, OsSOS1 suppressed the salt sensitivity of a sos1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis, OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4 acted coordinately to activate OsSOS1 in yeast cells and they could be exchanged with their Arabidopsis counterpart to form heterologous protein kinase modules that activated both OsSOS1 and AtSOS1 and suppressed the salt sensitivity of sos2 and sos3 mutants of Arabidopsis"
6. __shoot__, [Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress

8. __root__, [Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
9. __drought__, [Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress"
