## Key message
1. __flowering time__, [Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes%5BTitle%5D)),  One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
2. __flower__, [OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
3. __flower__, [Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes%5BTitle%5D)),  One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
