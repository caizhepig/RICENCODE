## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase
2. __salt__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)), " This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold"
3. __drought__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D)), " This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold"
4. __ethylene__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), ) phyAphyBphyC mutants lacking any phytochrome and containing the GCC box element, a binding site for rice ethylene-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsEREBP1), in its promoter region
5. __transcription factor__, [OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors%5BTitle%5D)),  Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
6. __ ABA __, [OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors%5BTitle%5D)),  This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold

## Connection

3. __EBL1__, __OsEREBP1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
