2. __drought__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
3. __submergence__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
4. __submergence tolerance__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
5. __drought tolerance__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
6. __drought stress__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Two allelic mutants of OsETOL1 showed increased resistance to drought stress at the panicle development stage. 
7. __abiotic stress__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The OsETOL1 transcript was differentially responsive to abiotic stresses. 

## Connection
1. __OsACS2__, __OsETOL1__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsETOL1 was found to interact with OsACS2, a homolog of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
