GA-responsive dwarf mutant defective in an early step of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  The osks1 mutant seedlings were responsive to exogenous gibberellin (GA3),3 kb were detected in leaves and stem of wild-type plants, but not in germinating seeds or roots, suggesting that OsKS1 is not involved in germination or root growth
