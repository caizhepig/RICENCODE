## Expression information

## Key message
1. __temperature__, ["LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants"%5BTitle%5D)), " Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical"

## Connection
1. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta, LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence, Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
