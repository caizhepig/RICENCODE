## Key message
1. __root apical meristem__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
2. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
3. __growth__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)%5BTitle%5D)),  The level of OsORC1 expression was significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium, When the growth-halted cells began to re-grow following addition of sucrose to the medium, OsORC1 was again expressed at high levels
4. __meristem__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
