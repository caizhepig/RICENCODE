## Key message
1. __disease__, [A novel simple extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domain protein from rice (OsLRR1) enters the endosomal pathway and interacts with the hypersensitive-induced reaction protein 1 (OsHIR1)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel simple extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domain protein from rice (OsLRR1) enters the endosomal pathway and interacts with the hypersensitive-induced reaction protein 1 (OsHIR1)%5BTitle%5D)),  The protective effects of OsLRR1 against bacterial pathogen infection were shown by the alleviating of disease symptoms, lowering of pathogen titres and higher expression of defence marker genes

## Connection
