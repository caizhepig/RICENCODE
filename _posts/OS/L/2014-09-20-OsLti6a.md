## Key message
1. __seedling__, [The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature%5BTitle%5D)),  Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar
2. __temperature__, [The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature%5BTitle%5D)), " Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar"

## Connection
1. __OsLti6a__, __OsLti6b~ddOs32__, [Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To compare the functions of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, the orthologous genes in rice (OsLti6a and OsLti6b) were isolated, Both OsLti6a and OsLti6b could functionally complement the loss of PMP3 in yeast, PutPMP3-2 and OsLti6a were more effective in reversing membrane hyperpolarization than PutPMP3-1 and OsLti6b
