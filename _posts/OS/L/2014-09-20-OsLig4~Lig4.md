## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsKu80~Ku80__, __OsLig4~Lig4__, [Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice calli from OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 knockdown (KD) plants were infected with Agrobacterium harboring a sensitive emerald luciferase (LUC) reporter construct to evaluate stable expression and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to monitor transient expression of T-DNA, In addition, suppression of OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 induced the expression of HR-related genes on treatment with DNA-damaging agents
