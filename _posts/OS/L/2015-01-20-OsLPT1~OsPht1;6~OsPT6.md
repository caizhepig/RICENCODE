2. __transporter__, [OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters
3. __transporter__, [Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter%5BTitle%5D)), A putative high-affinity phosphate (Pi) transporter gene in rice (Oryza sativa), OsLPT1, was isolated by RT-PCR from the leaves of the plants, The 1635-bp nucleotide sequence of OsLPT1 spans an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 535 amino acids with sequence similarity to phosphate transporters from other plant species
4. __ pi __, [Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsLPT1 in the roots was enhanced by Pi deprivation, The data suggests that the OsLPT1 protein may be involved in enhancing phosphate uptake under conditions of Pi starvation, and in the translocation of Pi among cells in shoots to increase the efficiency of internal Pi use
5. __transporter__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
6. __xylem__, [Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of cDNA for the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization revealed OsLPT1 expression in mesophyll cells, xylem parenchyma and phloem cells in the leaves, and in the epidermis, exodermis, and in the vasculature surrounding metaxylem vessels in the roots
