1. __seed__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development
2. __auxin__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsARF1 is the first full-length member of auxin response factor (ARF) gene family to be cloned from monocot plant,Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice
3. __auxin__, [OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene%5BTitle%5D)),  A rice homologue of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcriptional regulators, OsARF1, was identified, Steady-state levels of OsARF1 mRNA correlated positively with auxin-dependent differential growth: gravitropic stimulation enhanced the amount of OsARF1 transcript in the lower, faster-growing flank accompanied by a decrease in the upper flank of gravitropically stimulated rice coleoptiles, Exogenous auxin up-regulated the steady-state level of OsARF1 mRNA within 15-30 min, Thus, OsARF1 is the first ARF that classifies as an early auxin-responsive gene,OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene
4. __growth__, [Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  In R109 leaves, the OsARF1 gene, which regulates plant growth, was expressed in consistence with growth promotion by P, Inversely, OsARF1 expression was coincident with inhibition in growth of HER1 leaves
5. __growth__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The AS-OsARF1 plants showed extremely low growth, poor vigor, short curled leaves and tillered but were sterile, Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development
6. __sterile__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The AS-OsARF1 plants showed extremely low growth, poor vigor, short curled leaves and tillered but were sterile
7. __seed development__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development

10. __vegetative__, [Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Using quantitative RT-PCR this study found that, the transcript abundance of OsARF1 was significantly higher in embryonic tissues than in vegetative tissues, Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development
