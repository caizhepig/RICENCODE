## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress
2. __growth__, [Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling%5BTitle%5D)), Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling
3. __chilling__, ["Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa"%5BTitle%5D)), " To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity,Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa"
4. __seedling__, [Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  APXa mRNA levels increased within 1 h after seedlings were exposed to 42 °C, The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress, Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings
5. __temperature__, [Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe
