## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
2. __shoot__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
3. __root__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts
4. __sheath__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
5. __leaf__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves

## Connection
1. __OsAOS1__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots, The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts
2. __OsAOS3~OsHPL2__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves, OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively
3. __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, __OsHPL3__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  There are three HPLs in rice (Oryza sativa), designated OsHPL1 through OsHPL3, OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves, OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively
