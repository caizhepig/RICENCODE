## Key message
1. __seed__, [Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarxSwarna RILs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarxSwarna RILs%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus the high priority candidate genes for high Fe and Zn in seeds are OsYSL1 and OsMTP1 for iron, OsARD2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2 for zinc and OsNAS3, OsNRAMP1, Heavy metal ion transport and APRT for both iron and zinc together based on our genetic mapping studies as these genes strictly underlie QTLs
2. __zinc__, [Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarxSwarna RILs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarxSwarna RILs%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus the high priority candidate genes for high Fe and Zn in seeds are OsYSL1 and OsMTP1 for iron, OsARD2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2 for zinc and OsNAS3, OsNRAMP1, Heavy metal ion transport and APRT for both iron and zinc together based on our genetic mapping studies as these genes strictly underlie QTLs
