## Key message
1. __potassium__, [Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress%5BTitle%5D)),  To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1
2. __root__, [Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress%5BTitle%5D)),  To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1, OsAKT1 transcripts were predominantly found in the coleoptile and in the roots of young rice seedlings, Patch-clamp studies on rice root protoplasts identified a K+ inward rectifier with similar channel properties as heterologously expressed OsAKT1, In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts, Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots
3. __salt__, [Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress%5BTitle%5D)), " To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1, In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts, Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots,Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress"
