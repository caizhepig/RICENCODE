## Key message
1. __flower__, [Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsARP gene was introduced into tobacco under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter
2. __photosynthesis__, [Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type
3. __yield__, [Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type
4. __salt tolerance__, [Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco%5BTitle%5D)), " Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type,Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco"
5. __salt__, [Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco%5BTitle%5D)), " Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type,Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco"
