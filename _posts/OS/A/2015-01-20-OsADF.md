## Publication
1. [An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Planta.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study, we cloned and characterized a panicle-specific expression F-box protein, anther development F-box (OsADF) |  In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility |  Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility
