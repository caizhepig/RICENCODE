2. __ ABA __, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level
3. __ sa __, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level
4. __leaf__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsATX was responsive to cutting (wounding by cutting the excised leaf), over its weak constitutive expression in the healthy leaves, The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
5. __blast__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Finally, the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, triggered OsATX mRNA accumulation
6. __jasmonic acid__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
7. __salicylic acid__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
8. __ethylene__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
9. __defense__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest a function/role(s) for OsATX in defense/stress responses in rice
10. __jasmonic__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
