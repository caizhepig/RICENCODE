## Information
__Symbol__: OsABCC1,MRP1  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os04g52900](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g52900)  
__RAPdb__: [Os04g0620000](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os04g0620000)  

## Publication
1. [A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:OsABCC1 was expressed in many organs, including the roots, leaves, nodes, peduncle, and rachis  
__OverExpression__:NA  
__RNAi__:Knockout of OsABCC1 in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to As, but did not affect cadmium toxicity.
