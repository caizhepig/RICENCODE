## Expression information

## Key message
1. __flower__, [Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation
2. __seed__, [Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation

## Connection
1. __Osmyb1__, __Osmyb4__, [Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation
