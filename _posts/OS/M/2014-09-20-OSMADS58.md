## Key message
1. __floral__, [Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of the floral meristem is severely affected
2. __stamen__, [Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of the floral meristem is severely affected
3. __stamen__, [Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58%5BTitle%5D)),  The transgenic rice expressing OsMADS58SRDX had reiterated formation of lodicule-like organs instead of stamens and carpel, a typical phenotype of ag mutant, Although the transgenic tall fescue did not have the stamen alterations seen in SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX rice, they either produced no pollen or produced immature pollen; thus, the anthers were not dehiscent and the plants were male-sterile
4. __pollen__, [Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the transgenic tall fescue did not have the stamen alterations seen in SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX rice, they either produced no pollen or produced immature pollen; thus, the anthers were not dehiscent and the plants were male-sterile
5. __sterility__, [Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58%5BTitle%5D)),  We first introduced Os12g0207000SRDX, Os01g0886200SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX into rice for evaluation of their abilities to induce male sterility, We also obtained a mild phenotype of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue, which exhibited only the male sterility

10. __lemma__, [Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58%5BTitle%5D)),  Some lines of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue showed a cleistogamous phenotype in which the lodicules were homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs
