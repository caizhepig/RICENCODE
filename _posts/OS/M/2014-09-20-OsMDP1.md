## Key message
1. __root__, [A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root-elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath, OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations
2. __leaf__, [A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root-elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath
3. __lamina__, [A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations
