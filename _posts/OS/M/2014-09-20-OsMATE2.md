## Key message
1. __growth__, [Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
2. __disease resistance__, [Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
3. __disease__, [Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance

## Connection
