## Key message
1. __root__, [Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
2. __xylem__, [Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
3. __leaf__, [Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
4. __transporter__, [Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), 6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3
5. __cell wall__, [Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggested that OsMST3 is involved in the accumulation of monosaccharides required for cell wall synthesis at the stage of cell thickening
6. __sheath__, [Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
