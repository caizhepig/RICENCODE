## Key message
1. __stamen__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
2. __flower__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
3. __palea__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
4. __floral__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy, Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
5. __leaf__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
6. __lemma__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy, Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
