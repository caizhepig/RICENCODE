## Expression information

## Key message
1. __drought__, [Cloning and Expression Analysis of a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene OsMPK14 in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and Expression Analysis of a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene OsMPK14 in Rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression patterns of OsMPK14 in rice shoots and roots under darkness, drought, high salinity, low temperature and abscisic acid treatments, The OsMPK14 mRNA was induced by abscisic acid, low temperature and high salinity, but weakly inhibited by drought"
2. __temperature__, [Cloning and Expression Analysis of a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene OsMPK14 in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and Expression Analysis of a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene OsMPK14 in Rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression patterns of OsMPK14 in rice shoots and roots under darkness, drought, high salinity, low temperature and abscisic acid treatments, The OsMPK14 mRNA was induced by abscisic acid, low temperature and high salinity, but weakly inhibited by drought"
