## Key message
1. __flower__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
2. __meristem__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
3. __shoot__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
4. __transcription factor__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors
5. __seed__, [Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB%5BTitle%5D)),  A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening
6. __heading date__, [Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
