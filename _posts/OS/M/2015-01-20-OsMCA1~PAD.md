## Key message
1. __seed__, [Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
2. __shoot__, [Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
3. __root__, [Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
4. __growth__, [Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels

6. __architecture__, [A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice
7. __GA__, [A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice

9. __seedlings__, [A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice%5BTitle%5D)), PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
10. __node__, [A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice%5BTitle%5D)), PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
