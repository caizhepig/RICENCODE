## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment
2. __chilling__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment, Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation"
3. __anther__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment
4. __microspore__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation
5. __starch__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation

## Connection
1. __OSINV4__, __OsMST8__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation
2. __CSA__, __OsMST8__, [Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers, Furthermore, CSA was found to be associated in vivo and in vitro with the promoter of MST8
