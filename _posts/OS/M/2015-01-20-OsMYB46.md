## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Transcriptional activation of secondary wall biosynthesis by rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcriptional activation of secondary wall biosynthesis by rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors%5BTitle%5D)),  It was also found that the rice and maize MYB transcription factors, OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46, are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they were able to activate the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program
