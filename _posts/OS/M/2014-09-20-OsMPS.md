## Key message
1. __salt__, ["MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
2. __biomass__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass
3. __reproductive__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
4. __phytohormone__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP) and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes, The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth
5. __cytokinin__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide, Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid
6. __vegetative__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
7. __salt stress__, ["MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
8. __transcription factor__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, the role of MULTIPASS (OsMPS), an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice, was explored
9. __gibberellin__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide
10. __auxin__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide, Growth retardation caused by OsMPS over-expression is partially restored by auxin application, Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid
11. __growth__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D)),  Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass, Growth retardation caused by OsMPS over-expression is partially restored by auxin application, The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth
