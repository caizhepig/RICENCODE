## Key message
1. __seed__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D)),  We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
2. __root__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D)),  We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
3. __cell cycle__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D)),  Likewise, the OsMCM2 protein was ubiquitously expressed, but it was downregulated when nutritients were limiting, indicating that MCM2 expression (and therefore cell cycle progression) requires adequate nutrition
