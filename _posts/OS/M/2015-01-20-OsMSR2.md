1. __drought__, ["A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis"%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of OsMSR2 was strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of stresses, including cold, drought, and heat in different tissues at different developmental stages of rice, as revealed by both microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses, Expression of OsMSR2 conferred enhanced tolerance to high salt and drought in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accompanied by altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes, The results suggest that expression of OsMSR2 modulated salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis through ABA-mediated pathways,A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis"
