## Key message
1. __tiller__, [The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14%5BTitle%5D)),  An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers, OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering, Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14, Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering,The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
2. __growth__, [The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice, Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14

## Connection
1. __HTD2~D88~D14__, __OsMADS57__, [The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice, Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14, D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57-1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines, OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression, Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription, Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
