2. __AmyI-1~RAmy1A__, __OsMYBGA~OsGAMYB__, [Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy1A) of rice (Oryza sativa),Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone

9. __D1~RGA1__, __OsMYBGA~OsGAMYB__, [Rice dwarf mutantd1, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice dwarf mutantd1, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase
