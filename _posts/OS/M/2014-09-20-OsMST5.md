## Key message
1. __seed development__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
2. __flower__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
3. __grain__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
4. __seed__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
5. __transporter__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D)), cDNA of a monosaccharide transporter in rice, OsMST5 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporter 5) was cloned and its sugar transport activity was characterized by heterologous expression analysis,Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5
6. __transporter__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
7. __pollen__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D)),  Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice
8. __panicle__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D)),  Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice
9. __panicle__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination

## Connection
1. __OsMST5__, __OsSUT2~OsSUT2M__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs,OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively, Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination, These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
