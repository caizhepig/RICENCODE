2. __shoot__, [A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, OsPht1;1, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, OsPht1;1, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Pht1;1 (OsPT1), one of the 13 Pht1 Pi transporters in rice, was expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots, Transgenic plants of OsPT1 overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild-type control in Pi-sufficient shoots
3. __phosphate__, [Increased expression of OsPT1, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased expression of OsPT1, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPT1, however, was highly expressed in primary roots and leaves regardless of external phosphate concentrations, This finding was confirmed histochemically using transgenic rice plants that express the GUS reporter gene under the control of the OsPT1 promoter, which exhibited high GUS activity even in the phosphate sufficient condition, Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsPT1 gene accumulated almost twice as much phosphate in the shoots as did wild-type plants,Increased expression of OsPT1, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice
