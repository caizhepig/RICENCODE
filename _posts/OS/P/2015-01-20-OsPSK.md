## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha , a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha , a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Although PSK-α molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-α may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo
2. __growth__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor
3. __auxin__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin
4. __cytokinin__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin
