## Key message
1. __seed germination__, [The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions
2. __root__, [Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination%5BTitle%5D)), OsPIP1;1 is one of the most abundant aquaporins in rice leaves and roots and is highly responsible to environmental stresses, Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate
3. __salt__, [Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination%5BTitle%5D)), " Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate,Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination"
4. __seed__, [Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate,Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination
5. __seed germination__, [Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate,Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination
6. __yield__, [Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate
7. __seed__, [The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions, Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
