## Key message
1. __biomass__, [Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation
2. __shoot__, [Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment
3. __arsenite__, [Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment, Heterologous expression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of arsenite, Overexpression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation
4. __root__, [Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment
