## Information
__Symbol__: OsPP18,OsPP2C10  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os02g05630](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g05630)  
__RAPdb__: [Os02g0149800](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os02g0149800)  

## Publication
1. [A SNAC1-regulated protein phosphatase gene OsPP18 modulates drought and oxidative stress tolerance through ABA-independent reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A SNAC1-regulated protein phosphatase gene OsPP18 modulates drought and oxidative stress tolerance through ABA-independent reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:The expression of OsPP18 was induced by drought stress, but not induced by abscisic acid.  
__OverExpression__:Over-expression of OsPP18 in rice led to enhanced osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance.   
__RNAi__:The ospp18 mutant was more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages. Rice plants with OsPP18-suppresed via artificial microRNA were also hypersensitive to drought stress.
