## Key message
1. __auxin__, [Overexpression of OsPIL15, a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein gene, represses etiolated seedling growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPIL15, a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein gene, represses etiolated seedling growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray analysis combined with gene ontology analysis revealed that OsPIL15 represses a set of genes involved in auxin pathways and cell wall organization or biogenesis, Given the important roles of the auxin pathway and cell wall properties in controlling plant growth, we speculate that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth likely by regulating the auxin pathway and suppressing cell wall organization in etiolated rice seedlings
