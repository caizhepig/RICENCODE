## Connection
1. __Os11N3__, __Os8N3~xa13__, [Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3%5BTitle%5D)),  The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease,Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3
