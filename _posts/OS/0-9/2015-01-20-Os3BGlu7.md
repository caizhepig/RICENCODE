## Connection
1. __Os3BGlu7__, __Os3BGlu8__, [Rice family GH1 glycoside hydrolases with beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-mannosidase activities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice family GH1 glycoside hydrolases with beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-mannosidase activities%5BTitle%5D)),  Os3BGlu8, the amino acid sequence and molecular model of which are most similar to Os3BGlu7, hydrolysed 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4NPGlc) faster than 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside (4NPMan), while Os7BGlu26, which is most similar to rHvBII by these criteria, hydrolysed 4NPMan faster than 4NPGlc
