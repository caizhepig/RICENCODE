## Information
__Symbol__: OsglHAT1,GW6a  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os06g44100](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g44100)  
__RAPdb__: [Os06g0650300](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os06g0650300)  

## Publication
1. [Rare allele of a previously unidentified histone H4 acetyltransferase enhances grain weight, yield, and plant biomass in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rare allele of a previously unidentified histone H4 acetyltransferase enhances grain weight, yield, and plant biomass in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Elevated OsglHAT1 expression enhances grain weight and yield by enlarging spikelet hulls via increasing cell number and accelerating grain filling, and increases global acetylation levels of histone H4 |  Despite its positive agronomical effects on grain weight, yield, and plant biomass, the rare allele elevating OsglHAT1 expression has so far escaped human selection  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
