## Key message
1. __root__, [Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
2. __shoot__, [Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D)), We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library
3. __dwarf__, [C-terminal extension of rice glutamate decarboxylase (OsGAD2) functions as an autoinhibitory domain and overexpression of a truncated mutant results in the accumulation of extremely high levels of GABA in plant cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal extension of rice glutamate decarboxylase (OsGAD2) functions as an autoinhibitory domain and overexpression of a truncated mutant results in the accumulation of extremely high levels of GABA in plant cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Regenerated OsGAD2DeltaC rice plants had aberrant phenotypes such as dwarfism, etiolated leaves, and sterility

## Connection
1. __OsGAD1__, __OsGAD2__, [Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D)), We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library, Open reading frames found in OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 cDNAs encode putative proteins of 501 (56, Interestingly, in the regions in the putative gene products corresponding to the C-terminal 30-amino-acid peptide known as the calmodulin-binding domain of plant GADs, OsGAD1 possesses a typical motif, while OsGAD2 contains several substitutions of amino acids that contribute strongly to the binding of calmodulin (CaM), An in vitro CaM-binding assay of these proteins over-expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that OsGAD1 can in fact bind specifically to bovine CaM but OsGAD2 cannot, RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
