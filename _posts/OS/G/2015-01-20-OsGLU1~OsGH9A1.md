## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
2. __growth__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsGLU1 plays important roles in plant cell growth
3. __brassinosteroid__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression
4. __cell elongation__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
5. __gibberellin__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression
6. __cell wall__, [OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
