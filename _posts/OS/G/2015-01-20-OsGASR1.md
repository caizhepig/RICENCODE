## Expression information

## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
2. __cell division__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles

## Connection
1. __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)), Two different types of genes for rice GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) homologue genes, Oryza sativa GA-stimulated transcript-related gene 1 (OsGASR1) and gene 2 (OsGASR2), were found, OsGASR1 was limitedly but strongly expressed in florets while OsGASR2 was expressed in both florets and branches, These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
