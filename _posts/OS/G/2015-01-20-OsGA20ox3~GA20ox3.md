4. __leaf__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
5. __root__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
6. __seedling__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
7. __panicle__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
8. __anther__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
9. __pollen__, [Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
