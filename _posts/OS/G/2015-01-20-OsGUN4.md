## Expression information
__Expression__: The expression of OsGUN4, however, was significantly reduced in HYB compared with LTB in terms of both transcript abundance (0 |  In summary, we have identified an epi-allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter down-regulated its expression in rice

## Key message
1. __magnesium__, [C-terminal residues of oryza sativa GUN4 are required for the activation of the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase in chlorophyll synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal residues of oryza sativa GUN4 are required for the activation of the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase in chlorophyll synthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum magnesium chelatase activity requires pre-activation of OsChlH with OsGUN4, Mg(2+) and protoporphyrin-IX, OsGUN4 and OsChlH preincubated without protoporphyrin-IX yields magnesium chelatase activity similar to assays without OsGUN4, suggesting formation of a dead-end complex
