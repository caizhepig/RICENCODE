4. __cellulose__, [ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  The enzymatic analysis of root extracts from the wild-type and rt mutant indicated that RT hydrolyzes noncrystalline amorphous cellulose, The cellulose content was slightly increased but the crystallinity of cellulose was decreased in the rt root, In addition, the hemicellulose composition was different between wild-type and rt roots, Based on these results, we concluded that RT is involved in the disassembly of the cell wall for cell elongation in roots as well as for root cap exfoliation from the epidermal cell layer by hydrolyzing the noncrystalline amorphous cellulose fibers of cellulose microfibrils resulting in loosening of the hemicellulose and cellulose interaction
