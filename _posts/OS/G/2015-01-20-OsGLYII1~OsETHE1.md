## Key message
1. __root__, [Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
2. __calcium__, [Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
3. __stress__, [Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
4. __stress response__, [Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
5. __stress__, [Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.%5BTitle%5D)), Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.
6. __stress__, [Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.%5BTitle%5D)),  To this end, we show that the stress response of OsETHE1 is dependent on light and that darkness largely suppresses the stress response of this gene
