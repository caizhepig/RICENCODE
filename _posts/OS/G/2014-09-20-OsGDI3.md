## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, we show that OsGDI3 complement the yeast sec19-1 mutant, a temperature-sensitive allele of the yeast GDI gene, suggesting that OsGDI3 is a functional ortholog of yeast GDI"

## Connection
1. __OsGDI3__, __OsMSRMK2~OsMAP1~OsMPK5~OsMAPK2~OsMAPK5~OsBIMK1__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMAPK2 is one of OsGDI3 interacting proteins from yeast two-hybrid screens and subject to further analysis, A kinase assay showed that the autophosphorylation activity of OsMAPK2 is inhibited by OsGDI3 in vitro, Taken together, OsGDI3 functions as a negative regulator of OsMAPK2 through modulating its kinase activity
