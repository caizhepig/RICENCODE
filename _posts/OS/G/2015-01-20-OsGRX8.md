## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)), " Here, we report the role of a CC-type GRX gene from rice, OsGRX8, in abiotic stress tolerance, Further, the transgenic RNAi rice plants exhibited increased susceptibility to various abiotic stresses, which further confirmed the role of OsGRX8 in abiotic stress responses, Altogether, these findings suggest the role of OsGRX8 in regulating abiotic stress response and may be used to engineer stress tolerance in crop plants"
2. __auxin__, [Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGRX8 protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin, The over-expression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid
