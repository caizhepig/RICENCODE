## Key message
1. __mitosis__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
2. __grain__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
3. __pollen__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa), Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains, In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted, Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
4. __reproductive__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
