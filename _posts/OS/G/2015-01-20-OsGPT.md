## Key message
1. __seed__, [Cloning and characterization of a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator fromOryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator fromOryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  A cDNA clone encoding glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) was isolated from a cDNA library of immature seeds of rice and named as OsGPT
2. __grain__, [Cloning and characterization of a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator fromOryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator fromOryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsGPT gene maps on chromosome 8 of rice and is linked to the quantitative trait locus for 1000-grain weight
