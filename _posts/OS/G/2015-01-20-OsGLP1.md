## Key message
1. __biotic stress__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D)), " The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H(2)O(2) upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively"
2. __abiotic stress__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D)), " The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H(2)O(2) upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively"
3. __height__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
4. __cell wall__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
5. __vegetative__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues
6. __disease resistance__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D)), Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco
7. __disease__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant, Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
8. __dwarf__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant
9. __disease resistance__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
10. __disease__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D)), Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco
11. __cell wall__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D)), Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco, Our findings demonstrate that the OsGLP1 with its inherent SOD activity is responsible for hyper-accumulation of H(2)O(2) and reinforcement of the cell wall components
