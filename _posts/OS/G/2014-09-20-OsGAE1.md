## Key message
1. __meristem__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves
2. __root__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root
3. __reproductive__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth
4. __gibberellin__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)), The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth
5. __vegetative__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth
6. __shoot__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves
7. __growth__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth, These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice,The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth
8. __leaf__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Anti-OsGAE1 antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath, OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root, These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice
9. __sheath__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Anti-OsGAE1 antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath, OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root, These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice
