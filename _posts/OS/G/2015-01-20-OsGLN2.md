2. __endosperm__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsGLN2 gene is also expressed in germinating seeds, where its expression is predominant in endosperms rather than embryos
