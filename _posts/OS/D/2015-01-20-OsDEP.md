## Connection
1. __OsbHLH133__, __OsDEP__, [Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions
