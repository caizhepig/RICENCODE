## Key message
1. __ ga __, [Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D)),  To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells, In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex

## Connection
1. __OsWRKY51__, __OsWRKY71__, [Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D)),  To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells, The physical interactions of OsWRKY71 proteins themselves and that of OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY51 are revealed in the nuclei of aleurone cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, Although OsWRKY51 itself does not bind to the Amy32b promoter in vitro, it interacts with OsWRKY71 and enhances the binding affinity of OsWRKY71 to W boxes in the Amy32b promoter, In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
