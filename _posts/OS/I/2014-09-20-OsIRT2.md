## Key message
1. __growth__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D)),  When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant
2. __cadmium__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
3. __transporter__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
4. __root__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
5. __iron__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
6. __transporter__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2,Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice

## Connection
1. __OsIRT1__, __OsIRT2__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we isolated the OsIRT2 gene from rice, which is highly homologous to OsIRT1, Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions, OsIRT1- and OsIRT2-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion (Allium cepa L
