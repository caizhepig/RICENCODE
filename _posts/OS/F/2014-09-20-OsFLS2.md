## Key message
1. __growth__, [Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice
2. __cell death__, [Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin

## Connection
1. __OsFLS2__, __OsSERK2__, [An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2), Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
2. __OsFLS2__, __xa21__, [An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2), Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
3. __OsFLS2__, __Xa26~Xa3__, [An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2), Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
