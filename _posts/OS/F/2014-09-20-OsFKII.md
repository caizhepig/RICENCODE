## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
2. __grain__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds

## Connection
1. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)), Two cDNA clones, OsFKI and OsFKII, encoding fructokinase (EC 2, In contrast, OsFKII cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 336 amino acids that shared only 64% amino acid identity with OsFKI, The identity of OsFKI and OsFKII as fructokinases was confirmed by the expression of enzyme activity in E, Although both OsFKI and OsFKII utilized fructose as substrate, only OsFKII activity was strongly inhibited at a high fructose concentration, The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
