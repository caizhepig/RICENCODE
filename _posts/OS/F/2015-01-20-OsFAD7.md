## Key message
1. __seed__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds
2. __chloroplast__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds
