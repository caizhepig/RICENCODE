## Connection
1. __OsF5HL__, __OsF5HL2__, [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated twoF5H genes,OsF5HL andOsF5HL2, from a japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa L, Alignments of theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 cDNAs to their genomic DNAs revealed thatOsF5HL has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1590 b from four exons, whileOsF5HL2 has an ORF of 1560 b from two exons, Expression ofOsFSHL is highest in young leaves, whereas that ofOsF5HL2 is greatest in mature leaves, These data suggest that theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 genes belong to theCYP84 subfamily and that their expressions are tissue-specific
