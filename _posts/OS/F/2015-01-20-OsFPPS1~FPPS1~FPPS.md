## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, FPPS was detected in the chloroplast fraction in wheat, and was protected from proteolysis following trypsin treatment of chloroplasts, FPPS was also detected in the chloroplast fraction of a dicot plant, tobacco
2. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells
