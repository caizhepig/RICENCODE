## Key message
1. __peptidoglycan and chitin signaling__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
2. __chitin signaling__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
3. __peptidoglycan signaling__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
4. __innate immunity__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.

## Connection
1. __OsCERK1__, __OsRLCK176__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), Furthermore, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176 functions downstream of OsCERK1 in the PGN and chitin signaling pathways, suggesting that these MAMPs share overlapping intracellular signaling components.
