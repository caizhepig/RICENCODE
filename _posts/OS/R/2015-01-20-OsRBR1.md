## Key message
1. __Kinase__, [The B″ regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A mediates the dephosphorylation of rice retinoblastoma-related protein-1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The B″ regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A mediates the dephosphorylation of rice retinoblastoma-related protein-1.%5BTitle%5D)),  We found by immunoprecipitation that OsPP2A B″, OsPP2A catalytic subunit subtype II, PSTAIRE-type CDK and OsRBR1 were in the same protein complex, indicating a physical association between the phosphatase, the kinase and their common substrate
