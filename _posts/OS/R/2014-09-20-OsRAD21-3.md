## Key message
1. __pollen__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRAD21-3-deficient RNAi lines showed arrested pollen mitosis, aberrant pollen chromosome segregation and aborted pollen grains, which led to disrupted pollen viability, However, male meiosis in these RNAi lines did not appear to be severely disrupted, which suggests that the main involvement of OsRAD21-3 is in post-meiotic pollen development by affecting pollen mitosis, Furthermore, of the four OsRAD21 genes in the rice genome, only OsRAD21-3 was expressed in pollen grains,OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa
