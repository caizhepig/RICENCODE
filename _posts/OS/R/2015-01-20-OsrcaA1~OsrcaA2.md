## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ ga __, [Involvement of a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase component downstream to the gibberellin-binding phosphoprotein, RuBisCO activase, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase component downstream to the gibberellin-binding phosphoprotein, RuBisCO activase, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Kinase activities of these proteins were significantly reduced in the presence of uniconazole, a potent GA biosynthesis inhibitor, but one of them was strongly promoted by GA(3) treatment in transgenic plants carrying a smaller subunit of RuBisCO activase (OsrcaA1) compared to the larger subunit OsrcaA2
