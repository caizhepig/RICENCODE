## Key message
1. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)), A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene OsRING-1 was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening
2. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
3. __sheath__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
4. __stem__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
5. __ethylene__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region
6. __drought__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)), " The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region"
7. __transcription regulator__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, OsRING-1, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways
8. __ ja __, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern analysis showed that OsRING-1 was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments
