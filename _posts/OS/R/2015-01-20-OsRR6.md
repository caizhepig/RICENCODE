1. __salinity__, [Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)), " Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress"
2. __root__, [Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
3. __seedling__, [Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
4. __dwarf__, [Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
5. __cytokinin__, [Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
6. __abiotic stress__, [Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
7. __temperature__, [Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)), " Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress"
8. __shoot__, [Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling
9. __panicle__, [Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
