## Key message
1. __root__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment
2. __stem__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment
3. __blast__, [Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens
4. __salt__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance, This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance, The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance,Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling"
5. __salinity__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment, Promoter analysis showed that OsRacB promoter is induced by salinity and exogenous salicylic acid, not abscisic acid"
6. __jasmonic__, [Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid

8. __salt tolerance__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance, This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance, The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance"
