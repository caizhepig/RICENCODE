## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
2. __sterile__, [Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
3. __growth__, [Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
4. __vegetative__, [Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
5. __mitosis__, [Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
