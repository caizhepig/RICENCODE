## Connection
1. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment
2. __OsRACK1A__, __OsRAR1__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance
3. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1, Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex
4. __OsRACK1A__, __RACK1B~OsWD40-122__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
