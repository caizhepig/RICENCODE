## Key message
1. __leaf__, [The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D)),  In the paddy field, the bright green leaf (bgl) mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) exhibit a luminous green color that is clearly distinguishable from the normal green of wild-type plants, Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that small cuticular papillae (or small papillae; SP), nipple-like structures, are absent on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of bgl mutants, leading to more direct reflection and less diffusion of green light,The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces
2. __sheath__, [The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D)),  In agreement with the timing of SP initiation on the leaf epidermis, OsRopGEF10 is most strongly expressed in newly developing leaves before emergence from the leaf sheath

## Connection
1. __OsRac1__, __OsRopGEF10,BGL__, [The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D)),  In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane, These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development
