## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Under normal conditions, OsbZIP74 mRNA encodes a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with a putative transmembrane domain
2. __transcription factor__, [Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA, OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes
3. __leaf__, [Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  The activated form of OsbZIP74 has transcriptional activation activity in both yeast cells and Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts
4. __transcription factor__, [Multiple roles of the ER stress sensor IRE1 demonstrated by gene targeting in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple roles of the ER stress sensor IRE1 demonstrated by gene targeting in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ribonuclease mediates the unconventional splicing of mRNA encoding the transcription factor AtbZIP60 in Arabidopsis, or OsbZIP50 in rice, and thereby transduces signals from stressed ER
5. __stem__, [Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  When treating with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin and DTT, the conserved double stem-loop structures of OsbZIP74 mRNA are spliced out, We also demonstrate that the unconventional splicing of OsbZIP74 mRNA is associated with heat stress and salicylic acid, which is an important plant hormone in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen or parasite
6. __salicylic acid__, [Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  We also demonstrate that the unconventional splicing of OsbZIP74 mRNA is associated with heat stress and salicylic acid, which is an important plant hormone in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen or parasite
