## Key message
1. __seed__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1
2. __endosperm__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1

## Connection
1. __OsBip1__, __OsBiP4__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions, However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice, When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1, Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice
2. __IRE1~OsIRE1__, __OsBip1__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice, Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice
3. __OsBip1__, __OsBiP5__, [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions
