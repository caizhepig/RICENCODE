2. __shoot__, [The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type
3. __root__, [The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type, In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots
