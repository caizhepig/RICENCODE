## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sheath__, [Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpresion of OsCRY1b resulted in a blue light-dependent short hypcotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis, and a short coleoptile, leaf sheath and leaf blade phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa)
2. __leaf__, [Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpresion of OsCRY1b resulted in a blue light-dependent short hypcotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis, and a short coleoptile, leaf sheath and leaf blade phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa)

## Connection
1. __OsCRY1a__, __OsCRY1b__, [Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation%5BTitle%5D)),  By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes
2. __OsCRY1a__, __OsCRY1b__, [Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1%5BTitle%5D)),  On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), the C-terminal domain of either OsCRY1a (OsCCT1a) or OsCRY1b (OsCCT1b) mediated a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype in both Arabidopsis and rice, whereas OsCCT1b mutants corresponding to missense mutations in previously described Arabidopsis cry1 alleles failed to confer a COP phenotype
