## Expression information

## Key message
1. __defense__, [Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor%5BTitle%5D)), " These data suggest that OsCLP, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens"
2. __cell wall__, [Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, exogenous treatment with OsCLP affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall
3. __growth__, [Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, exogenous treatment with OsCLP affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall
