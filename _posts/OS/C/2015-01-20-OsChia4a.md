5. __transcription factor__, [Identification of an E-box motif responsible for the expression of jasmonic acid-induced chitinase gene OsChia4a in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of an E-box motif responsible for the expression of jasmonic acid-induced chitinase gene OsChia4a in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results imply that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is likely to be involved in the regulation of the OsChia4a expression in a JA-dependent manner
