## Key message
1. __aluminum tolerance__, [A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals.
2. __aluminum tolerance__, [A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), Expression of OsCDT3 in yeast conferred tolerance to Al, but not to Cd.
3. __aluminum tolerance__, [A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), Taken together, our results indicate that OsCDT3 anchoring to the plasma membrane may play a role in stopping entry of Al into the root cells by binding Al, therefore, contributing to high Al tolerance in rice.
4. __root__, [A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals.

## Connection
1. __ART1__, __OsCDT3__, [A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine.
