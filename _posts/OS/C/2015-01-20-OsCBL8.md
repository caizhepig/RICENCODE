## Key message
1. __drought__, [Preliminary Study on Function of Calcineurin B-Like Protein Gene OsCBL8 in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Preliminary Study on Function of Calcineurin B-Like Protein Gene OsCBL8 in Rice%5BTitle%5D)), " By evaluation of the tolerance to 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20% PEG6000 and low temperature treatments, and relevant physiological indices, 8F12, a sense transgenic line with high salt tolerance, and 8R14, an antisense transgenic line with high drought tolerance, were obtained, which suggests that the OsCBL8 gene is involved in the response of rice to abiotic stresses"
