## Key message
1. __disease__, [Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 increases Arabidopsis resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and rice resistance against Magnaporthe grisea](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 increases Arabidopsis resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and rice resistance against Magnaporthe grisea%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA- and JA-dependent defense responses
