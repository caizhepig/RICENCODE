## Key message
1. __root__, [Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  There was also a corresponding increase in the protein and the enzyme activity of OscTPI both in shoot and root tissues under MG stress
2. __shoot__, [Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  There was also a corresponding increase in the protein and the enzyme activity of OscTPI both in shoot and root tissues under MG stress

4. __abiotic stress__, [Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Real time PCR analysis revealed that OscTPI transcript level was regulated in response to various abiotic stresses
