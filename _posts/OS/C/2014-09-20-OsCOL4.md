## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days, In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment, By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways, In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB,OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB

2. __OsCOL4__, __RFT1__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
3. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants, This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1, These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1,OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
