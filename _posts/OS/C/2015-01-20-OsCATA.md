## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsCATA__, __OsCATB__, [ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
2. __OsCATA__, __OsCATC~noe1__, [ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
