## Expression information

## Key message
1. __nitrate__, [Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase
2. __cell death__, [Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death, The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death, Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants, Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1, NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals
3. __leaf__, [Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death, The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death, Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants, Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1

## Connection
1. __OsCATB__, __OsCATC~noe1__, [ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB, Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner, When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress
2. __OsCATA__, __OsCATC~noe1__, [ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
