## Key message
1. __root hair__, [OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs, Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation, Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells, Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins,OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice
2. __cell wall__, [Root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant represents a loss-of-function allele of the cellulose synthase-like gene OsCSLD1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant represents a loss-of-function allele of the cellulose synthase-like gene OsCSLD1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsCSLD1 was expressed not only in root hairs but also in epidermal and cortex cell walls except for stele
