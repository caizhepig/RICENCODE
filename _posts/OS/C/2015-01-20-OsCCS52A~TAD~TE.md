## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels
2. __grain__, [Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1%5BTitle%5D)),  We conclude that besides having a conserved role in regulating cell cycle, APC/C(TE) has a unique function in regulating the plant-specific postembryonic shoot branching and tillering, which are major determinants of plant architecture and grain yield
3. __flower__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels
4. __cell cycle__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, rice cell cycle switch 52 A (OsCCS52A), an APC activator, is functionally characterized using the reverse genetic approach
5. __cell elongation__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, overexpression of OsCCS52A inhibits mitotic cell division and induces endoreduplication and cell elongation in fission yeast
6. __vegetative__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  A cycle of endoreduplication is common in most of the differentiated cells of plant vegetative tissues and it occurs extensively in cereal endosperm cells
7. __endosperm__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
8. __cell division__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, overexpression of OsCCS52A inhibits mitotic cell division and induces endoreduplication and cell elongation in fission yeast, Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
9. __seed__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels, Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
10. __seed size__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
11. __grain__, [Degradation of MONOCULM 1 by APC/C(TAD1) regulates rice tillering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Degradation of MONOCULM 1 by APC/C(TAD1) regulates rice tillering%5BTitle%5D)), A rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that contributes greatly to grain yield
12. __cell division__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
13. __panicle__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels
