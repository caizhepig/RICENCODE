## Key message
1. __salinity__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)), " Overexpression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to the stress hormone, abscisic acid, and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration"
2. __auxin__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
3. __flower__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus
4. __cytokinin__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid

## Connection
1. __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __OsTOP6B__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
2. __OsTOP6A3__, __OsTOP6B__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus, The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid, Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1, The nuclear localization of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was established by the transient expression of their beta-glucuronidase fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells, Overexpression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to the stress hormone, abscisic acid, and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration
3. __OsTOP6B__, __TOP6A2__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus, The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid, Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
