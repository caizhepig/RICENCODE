## Key message
1. __salicylic acid__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
2. __senescence__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding), These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
3. __chloroplast__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that Osh69 is specifically localized in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves, These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
4. __jasmonic__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
5. __leaf__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding), These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
6. __jasmonic acid__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
