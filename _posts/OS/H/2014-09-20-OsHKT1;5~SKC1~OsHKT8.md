5. __xylem__, [A rice quantitative trait locus for salt tolerance encodes a sodium transporter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice quantitative trait locus for salt tolerance encodes a sodium transporter%5BTitle%5D)),  SKC1 is preferentially expressed in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels
