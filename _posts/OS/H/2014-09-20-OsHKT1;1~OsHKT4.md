## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress"
2. __transporter__, [Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model%5BTitle%5D)),  Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
3. __root__, [Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model%5BTitle%5D)),  In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
4. __shoot__, [Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model%5BTitle%5D)),  In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
5. __salt__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress"
