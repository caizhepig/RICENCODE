4. __salt__, ["HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism"%5BTitle%5D)), " Our study, however, also identified a new HKT isoform, No-OsHKT2;2/1 in Nona Bokra, a highly salt-tolerant cultivar, Its 5' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;2, whose full-length sequence is not present in Nipponbare but has been identified in Pokkali, a salt-tolerant rice cultivar, Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions"
5. __root__, [HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism%5BTitle%5D)),  No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na(+) concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1, Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions
