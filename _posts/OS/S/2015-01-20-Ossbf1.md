## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family%5BTitle%5D)),  One of the isolated cDNAs represented a novel protein, OsSBF1, with high homology to mammalian Na+/bile acid transporters and to sodium‐dependent transporters from bacteria
2. __growth__, [The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsSbf1 in deep‐water rice was shown to be elevated by growth‐inducing treatments
