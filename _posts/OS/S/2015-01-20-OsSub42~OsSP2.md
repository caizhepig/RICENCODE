## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We validated the stage-specificity of regulatory regions of three panicle-specific genes, OsAGO3, OsSub42, and RTS, and an early seed-specific gene, XYH, in transgenic rice
2. __seed__, [Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We validated the stage-specificity of regulatory regions of three panicle-specific genes, OsAGO3, OsSub42, and RTS, and an early seed-specific gene, XYH, in transgenic rice

## Connection
