## Expression information

## Key message
1. __mitosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase, Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis
2. __meiotic__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
3. __meiosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase, In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II, Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis,OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis
