## Expression information

## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the induction of the OsSAMDC gene in response to cold may be used as a molecular marker for the ability of rice seedlings to withstand exposure to low temperatures
2. __abiotic stress__, [Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes%5BTitle%5D)),  We also analyzed the response of OsSAMDC to various abiotic stress treatments and plant hormones
3. __resistant__, [Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes%5BTitle%5D)),  Upon exposure to cold stress (5 degrees C) the level of OsSAMDC transcripts in the cold-resistant Yukihikari genotype continued to increase for up to 72 h
4. __seedling__, [Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the induction of the OsSAMDC gene in response to cold may be used as a molecular marker for the ability of rice seedlings to withstand exposure to low temperatures
5. __cold stress__, [Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes%5BTitle%5D)),  Upon exposure to cold stress (5 degrees C) the level of OsSAMDC transcripts in the cold-resistant Yukihikari genotype continued to increase for up to 72 h
