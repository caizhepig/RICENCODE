## Key message
1. __salt tolerance__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Retransformation of wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that OsSMCP1 is responsible for conferring the salt tolerance
2. __salt__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Retransformation of wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that OsSMCP1 is responsible for conferring the salt tolerance
3. __salinity__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), " It is particularly interesting that R07047 and newly constructed OsSMCP1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to high salinity but also to osmotic, dehydrative, and oxidative stresses"
4. __biotic stress__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis
5. __breeding__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  For molecular breeding to improve the tolerance of crops against environmental stress, OsSMCP1 is a promising candidate
6. __oxidative__, [Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), " It is particularly interesting that R07047 and newly constructed OsSMCP1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to high salinity but also to osmotic, dehydrative, and oxidative stresses"
