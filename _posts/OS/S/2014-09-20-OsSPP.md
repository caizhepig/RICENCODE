## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets, OsSPPs are located in both the undifferentiated cells, and the early differentiated cells at the shoot apex
2. __panicle__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
3. __vegetative__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
