## Expression information

## Key message
1. __stem__, [Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSIK1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsSIK1 is expressed mainly in the stem and spikelet in rice, These results indicate that OsSIK1 plays important roles in salt and drought stress tolerance in rice, through the activation of the antioxidative system
2. __stomata__, [Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice
3. __stomatal__, [Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice
