## Key message
1. __culm__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
2. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1)
3. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
