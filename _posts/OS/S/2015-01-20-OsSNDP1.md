## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs
2. __root hair__, [OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs, Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was utilized to further characterize the effect of the Ossndp1 mutation on root hair morphology,OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice
