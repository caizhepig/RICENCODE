## Connection
1. __OsBISERK1~OsSERK1~OsBAK1__, __OsSERK2__, [Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family
2. __OsFLS2__, __OsSERK2__, [An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2), Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
3. __OsSERK2__, __xa21__, [An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2), OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo, Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR,An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors
