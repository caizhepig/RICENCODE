## Key message

## Connection
1. __Ossmt1-1__, __Ossmt2-1__, [Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  We now report the comparison of two cDNAs isolated from Nicotiana tabacum, Ntsmt1-1 which belongs to the first SMT cDNA family and Ntsmt2-1 which belongs to the second, Whereas erg6 is devoid of 24-alkyl sterols, erg6 Ntsmt1-1 contained a majority of 24-methylene sterols and erg6 Ntsmt2-1, a majority of 24-ethylidene sterols, indicating distinct functions for the expression products of these cDNAs, tabacum, one (Ntsmt1-1) belongs to the first family of plant SMT cDNAs according to its deduced amino acid sequence and was shown to encode a cycloartenol C24 methyltransferase, whereas another (Ntsmt2-1) belongs to the second family and was shown to encode a 24-methylene lophenol C24 methyltransferase
