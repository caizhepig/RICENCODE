## Key message
1. __pollen__, [A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development%5BTitle%5D)), A pollen-expressed gene from rice, OsPCBP, that was previously cloned and identified encodes a novel calmodulin-binding protein, Our experimental results provide convincing evidence that OsPCBP protein plays an important role during the late stage of pollen development
2. __microspore__, [A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological observations at different stages revealed that microspores from the OsPCBP double-stranded RNA interference plants developed normally until the binucleate stage, but about half were later aborted
3. __anther__, [A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsPCBP in transgenic rice plants did not lead to phenotypic changes but did delay anther formation by about 1 week
