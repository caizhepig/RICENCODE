## Key message
1. __insect__, [Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli%5BTitle%5D)),  The recombinant inhibitor had strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin, with an equimolar relationship, comparable with that of native RASI, and weak inhibitory activity toward some microbial alpha-amylases, but not toward animal or insect alpha-amylases
2. __seed__, [Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli%5BTitle%5D)),  RASI was found to be expressed only in seeds, suggesting that it has a seed-specific function, These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms
3. __defense__, [Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms
