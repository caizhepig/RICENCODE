## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
2. __growth__, [Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, whereas rgp1 shows maximal expression at a particular stage of plantlet growth, rgp2 is constitutively expressed during the same period
3. __stem__, [Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
4. __panicle__, [Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
