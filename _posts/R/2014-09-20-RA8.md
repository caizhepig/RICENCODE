## Key message
1. __sterile__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants
2. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), An anther-specific cDNA clone of rice, RA8, was isolated from an anther cDNA library by differential screening, RNA blot analysis indicated that the RA8 transcript is present specifically in anthers and the transcript level increased as flowers matured, reaching the highest level in mature flowers, Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers, The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants,Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
3. __tapetum__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers
