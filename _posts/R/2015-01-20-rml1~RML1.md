## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Transcript abundance of rml1, encoding a putative GT1-like factor in rice, is up-regulated by Magnaporthe grisea and down-regulated by light](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript abundance of rml1, encoding a putative GT1-like factor in rice, is up-regulated by Magnaporthe grisea and down-regulated by light%5BTitle%5D)),  The putative RML1 protein, encoded by this single copy gene, is thus identified as a new member of the plant-specific GT family of transcription factors in rice
