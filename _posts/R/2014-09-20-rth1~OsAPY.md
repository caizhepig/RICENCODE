## Expression information

## Key message
1. __growth__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype, OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
2. __root__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype, We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY, OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
3. __growth__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype
4. __root hair__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype, We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY, OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
5. __root hair__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To better understand genetic control of root hair formation in rice, we analyzed root hairless 1 (rth1) mutant that was induced by NaN3 treatment, SEM observation showed that in rth1 plants, root hair elongation was abolished after the formation of bulge, Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype, We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY,Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice
