## Connection
1. __RGA4__, __RGA5__, [A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes%5BTitle%5D)),  DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4, An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function, A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection
