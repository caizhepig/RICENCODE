## Key message
1. __reproductive__, [Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed
2. __panicle__, [Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice
3. __inflorescence architecture__, [Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs
