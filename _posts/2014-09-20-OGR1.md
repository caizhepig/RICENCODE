[FJ527826](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ527826), [FJ527826](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ527826)

## Key message
1. __growth__, [Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D)),  This mutation, named opaque and growth retardation 1 (ogr1), was generated by T-DNA insertion into a gene that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein containing the DYW motif, We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development
2. __mitochondria__, [Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D)),  The OGR1-sGFP fusion protein is localized to mitochondria, We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development,Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria
