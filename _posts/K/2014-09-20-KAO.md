## Key message
1. __ ga __, [An overview of gibberellin metabolism enzyme genes and their related mutants in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An overview of gibberellin metabolism enzyme genes and their related mutants in rice%5BTitle%5D)), To enhance our understanding of GA metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa), we intensively screened and identified 29 candidate genes encoding the following GA metabolic enzymes using all available rice DNA databases: ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox)
