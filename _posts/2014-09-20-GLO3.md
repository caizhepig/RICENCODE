## Genbank accession number

## Key message
1. __root__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root

## Connection
1. __GLO1__, __GLO3__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root, Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5
2. __GLO3__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root, Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5
