## Key message
1. __cell division__, [Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ%5BTitle%5D)),  We ascribe a function for OsMADS2 in controlling cell division and differentiation along the proximal-distal axis, The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
2. __architecture__, [Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ%5BTitle%5D)),  The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
3. __organ size__, [Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMADS2 is required to trigger parenchymatous and lodicule-specific vascular development while maintaining a small organ size
4. __growth__, [Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data implicate the developmentally late spatially restricted accumulation of OsMADS2 transcripts in the differentiating lodicule to control growth of these regions
5. __stamen__, [Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ%5BTitle%5D)),  Grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes and in rice (Oryza sativa) one these genes, OsMADS2, controls lodicule formation without affecting stamen development, The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
6. __floral__, [Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning%5BTitle%5D)), Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning
