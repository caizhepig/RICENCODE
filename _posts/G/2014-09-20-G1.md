## Key message
1. __sterile__, [The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we have examined a long sterile lemma1 (g1) mutant, in which the sterile lemma is enlarged like the lemma, Detailed phenotypic analysis reveals that the large sterile lemma in the g1 mutant appears to be caused by homeotic transformation of the sterile lemma into a lemma, suggesting that G1 is involved in the repression of lemma identity to specify the sterile lemma, G1 mRNA is expressed in sterile lemma primordia throughout their development, and G1 protein is localized in the nucleus, We also show that a wild rice species, Oryza grandiglumis, that forms large sterile lemmas has serious mutations in the G1 gene,The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet
