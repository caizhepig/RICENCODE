## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, Î²-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines"
