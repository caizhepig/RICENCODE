## Key message
1. __cell division__, [A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A%20QTL%20for%20rice%20grain%20width%20and%20weight%20encodes%20a%20previously%20unknown%20RING-type%20E3%20ubiquitin%20ligase%5BTitle%5D)), Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis

Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield. The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops
