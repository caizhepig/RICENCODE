## Publication
1. [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2011, Nat Genet.

## Genbank accession number
[JN256055](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JN256055), [JN256056](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JN256056), [JN256057](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JN256057), [JN256058](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JN256058)

## Expression information
__Expression__:In particular, the transcript was much more abundant in NIL(ZS97) than in NIL(H94) in the palea/lemma at 2, 4 and 5 d before heading, and in the endosperm at 10 d after fertilization.  
__OverExpression__:None  
__RNAi__:None  

## Key message
1. __grain width__, [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight
2. __grain size__, [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight, GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size, The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2),Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice
3. __grain__, [Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight, GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size, The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2),Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice
