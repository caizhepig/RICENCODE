## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [A highly efficient rice green tissue protoplast system for transient gene expression and studying light/chloroplast-related processes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A highly efficient rice green tissue protoplast system for transient gene expression and studying light/chloroplast-related processes%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of the GFP-tagged light-related transcription factor OsGLK1 markedly upregulated transcript levels of the endogeneous photosynthetic genes OsLhcb1, OsLhcp, GADPH and RbcS, which were reduced to some extent by NF treatment in the rice green tissue protoplasts
