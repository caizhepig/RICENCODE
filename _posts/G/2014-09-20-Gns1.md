## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
2. __fertility__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
3. __disease__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene, To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
4. __blast disease__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
5. __growth__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
