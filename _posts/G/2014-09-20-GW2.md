## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cell division__, [A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis
2. __grain__, [Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
3. __cell cycle__, [Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
4. __grain__, [A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield, The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops
5. __grain yield__, [A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase%5BTitle%5D)),  The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops
