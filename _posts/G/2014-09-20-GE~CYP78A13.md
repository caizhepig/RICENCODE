## Key message
1. __grain yield__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development
2. __grain__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development
3. __cell death__, [GIANT EMBRYO encodes CYP78A13, required for proper size balance between embryo and endosperm in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(GIANT EMBRYO encodes CYP78A13, required for proper size balance between embryo and endosperm in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The function of GE in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm
4. __shoot__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance
5. __meristem__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance
6. __endosperm__, [GIANT EMBRYO encodes CYP78A13, required for proper size balance between embryo and endosperm in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(GIANT EMBRYO encodes CYP78A13, required for proper size balance between embryo and endosperm in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The function of GE in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm, GE, which encodes CYP78A13, is predominantly expressed in the interfacing tissues of the both embryo and endosperm, In contrast to the loss-of-function mutant with large embryo and small endosperm, GE overexpression causes a small embryo and enlarged endosperm, A complementation analysis coupled with heterofertilization showed that complementation of ge mutation in either embryo or endosperm failed to restore the wild-type embryo/endosperm ratio, Among genes associated with embryo/endosperm size, REDUCED EMBRYO genes, whose loss-of-function causes a phenotype opposite to ge, are revealed to regulate endosperm size upstream of GE, To fully understand the embryo-endosperm size control, the genetic network of the related genes should be elucidated
7. __yield__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development
8. __endosperm__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying embryo and endosperm development remains largely unknown, particularly in rice, the model cereal, GE is expressed predominantly in the scutellar epithelium, the interface region between embryo and endosperm, Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development
9. __seed__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of GE resulted in a large embryo in the seed, which was caused by excessive expansion of scutellum cells, Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance, Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtCYP78A10, a GE homolog, also produced bigger seeds, implying a conserved role for the CYP78A subfamily of P450s in regulating seed development
10. __seed development__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtCYP78A10, a GE homolog, also produced bigger seeds, implying a conserved role for the CYP78A subfamily of P450s in regulating seed development
11. __shoot apical meristem__, [Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450%5BTitle%5D)),  Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance
