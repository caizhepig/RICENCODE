1. __root__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation
2. __transcription factor__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity, Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb,Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response
3. __growth__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation
4. __jasmonate__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb
5. __disease__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response
6. __seedling__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation, In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response
7. __salinity__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity, JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation, In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response"
8. __homeostasis__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis
9. __seed__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation, In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response
10. __seed germination__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation
11. __salinity stress__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)), " JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation"
12. __abiotic stress__, [Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response%5BTitle%5D)), " In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response, Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice,Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response"
