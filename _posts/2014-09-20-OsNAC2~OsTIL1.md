## Key message
1. __branching__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice
2. __tiller__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation
3. __tiller__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
4. __tillering__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
5. __dwarf__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
6. __yield__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice
7. __shoot__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice
8. __tiller angle__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
9. __growth__, [Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation
