## Publication
1. [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2011, J Plant Physiol.

## Key message
1. __senescence__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR or quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment, These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses

## Connection
1. __OsPAO__, __OsRCCR1__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this report, a single PAO gene (OsPAO) and two RCCR genes (OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2) have been isolated from rice, These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses,Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice
