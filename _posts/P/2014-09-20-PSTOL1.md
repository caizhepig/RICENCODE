## Key message
1. __yield__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
2. __root__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients
3. __phosphorus__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  However, its functional mechanism remained elusive until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene, which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1), Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil, Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients,The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency
4. __grain__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
5. __submergence__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)), " The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm"
6. __growth__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients
7. __grain yield__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
