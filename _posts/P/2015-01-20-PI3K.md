## Key message
1. __growth__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)), Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses
2. __seed germination__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity, Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination, Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination
3. __seed__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity, Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination, Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination
