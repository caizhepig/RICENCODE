## Key message
1. __iron__, [A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele%5BTitle%5D)),  In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased, The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele, We show that PEZ1 is responsible for an increase of PCA concentration in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated iron in the stele
2. __transporter__, [The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron%5BTitle%5D)),  Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
3. __growth__, [A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele%5BTitle%5D)),  The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele
4. __cadmium__, [A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified a cadmium-accumulating rice mutant in which the amount of PCA and caffeic acid in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced and hence named it phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
5. __xylem__, [The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron%5BTitle%5D)),  Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
