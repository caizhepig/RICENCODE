## Key message
1. __meristem__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D)),  A supershift assay using an anti-PCF2 antibody showed the involvement of PCF2 in site IIa (site IIb) binding activities in rice nuclear extracts, particularly in meristematic tissues, Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers

## Connection
1. __PCF1__, __PCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D)),  The two DNA binding proteins, designated PCF1 and PCF2, share > 70% homology in common conserved sequences at the N-terminal regions, The motif is > 70% homologous to several expressed sequence tags from Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that PCF1 and PCF2 are members of a novel family of proteins that are conserved in monocotyledons and dicotyledons, PCF1 and PCF2 were also more likely to form heterodimers than homodimers, Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers,PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene
