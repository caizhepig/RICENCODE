## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [PF1: an A-T hook-containing DNA binding protein from rice that interacts with a functionally defined d(AT)-rich element in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PF1: an A-T hook-containing DNA binding protein from rice that interacts with a functionally defined d(AT)-rich element in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter%5BTitle%5D)),  Because this is the behavior expected of positive factor 1 (PF1), the presumptive nuclear transcription factor that acts in trans at the PE1 element in vivo, the data support the conclusion that the protein encoded by pR4 is in fact rice PF1

## Connection
1. __PF1__, __PHYA__, [The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter%5BTitle%5D)), The DNA-binding proteins PF1 and GT-2 are factors that bind to different functionally defined, positively acting cis-elements in the PHYA genes of oat and rice, respectively, The evidence indicates therefore that PF1 and GT-2 do not perform functionally equivalent roles in positively regulating oat and rice PHYA gene expression,The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter
2. __GT-2__, __PF1__, [The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter%5BTitle%5D)), The DNA-binding proteins PF1 and GT-2 are factors that bind to different functionally defined, positively acting cis-elements in the PHYA genes of oat and rice, respectively, PF1 is an HMG-I/Y protein, with its cognate cis-element being an AT-rich sequence, designated PE1, whereas GT-2 is a transcriptional activator with twin DNA binding domains that recognize a triplet of GT-boxes in a complex motif designated GTE, When co-incubated with GT-2, PF1 enhances the specific DNA-binding activity of GT-2 toward GTE, the first report of such activity for a plant HMG-I/Y protein, The evidence indicates therefore that PF1 and GT-2 do not perform functionally equivalent roles in positively regulating oat and rice PHYA gene expression,The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter
