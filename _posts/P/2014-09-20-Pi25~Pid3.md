## Expression information

## Key message
1. __blast resistance__, [A Pid3 allele from rice cultivar Gumei2 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Pid3 allele from rice cultivar Gumei2 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D)), ) blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated Pi25, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2, Over-expression analysis and complementation test showed that Pi25 conferred blast resistance to M, Although the mechanism of Pi25/Pid3-mediated resistance needs to be further investigated, the isolation of the allele would facilitate the utilization of Pi25/Pid3 in rice blast resistance breeding program via transgenic approach and marker assisted selection
