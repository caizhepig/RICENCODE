1. __PFL__, __Roc5~oul1__, [Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1, The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function
