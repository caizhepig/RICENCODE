## Key message
1. __root__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding region, The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding regions, Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%), Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
2. __leaf__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%), Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA
3. __nitrate__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
