## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria%5BTitle%5D)),  A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two IF 1 genes and the amino acid sequence of the mature IF1 protein from potato revealed that IF1-1 and IF1-2 have N-terminal extensions with features that are characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting signal

## Connection
1. __IF1-1__, __IF1-2__, [Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria%5BTitle%5D)),  A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two IF 1 genes and the amino acid sequence of the mature IF1 protein from potato revealed that IF1-1 and IF1-2 have N-terminal extensions with features that are characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting signal, To determine the subcellular localization of the gene products, the IF1-1 or IF1-2 proteins were fused in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the fused GFP-Î²-glucuronidase, and expressed transiently in onion or dayflower epidermal cells
