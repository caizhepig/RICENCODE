## Key message
1. __disease__, [OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance, The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice
