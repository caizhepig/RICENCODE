## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10)
2. __shoot__, [Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions
3. __transporter__, [OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters
4. __lateral root__, [Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPT9 and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation
5. __ pi __, [Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPT9 and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation, High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing OsPT9 and OsPT10, Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis, Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions, Taken together, our results suggest that OsPT9 and OsPT10 redundantly function in Pi uptake
