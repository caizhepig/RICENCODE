## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare), we characterized a cDNA clone encoding mitochondrial ALDH from rice (Aldh2a), Analysis of sub-cellular localization of ALDH2a protein using green fluorescent protein and an in vitro ALDH assay using protein extracts from Escherichia coli cells that overexpressed ALDH2a indicated that ALDH2a functions in the oxidation of acetaldehyde in mitochondria

3. __sheath__, [Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the Aldh2a mRNA was present at high levels in leaves of dark-grown seedlings, mature leaf sheaths, and panicles

5. __panicle__, [Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the Aldh2a mRNA was present at high levels in leaves of dark-grown seedlings, mature leaf sheaths, and panicles
6. __seedling__, [Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the Aldh2a mRNA was present at high levels in leaves of dark-grown seedlings, mature leaf sheaths, and panicles, It is interesting that expression of the rice Aldh2a gene, unlike the expression of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Aldh2a gene, was induced in rice seedlings by submergence
