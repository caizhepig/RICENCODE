## Key message
1. __flower__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens, Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants
2. __fertility__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
3. __sterile__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
4. __vegetative__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
5. __meiosis__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)), The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants,Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
6. __pollen__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens, SDS deficiency also caused a decrease in pollen amounts
7. __meiotic__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation,Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
