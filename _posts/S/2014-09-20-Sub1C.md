## Connection
1. __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond%5BTitle%5D)),  The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele, The roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data, An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant, Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important
