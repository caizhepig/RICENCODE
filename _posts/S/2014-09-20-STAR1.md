## Expression information

## Key message
1. __Al tolerance__, [A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance, Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants
2. __root__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Both STAR1 and STAR2 are expressed mainly in the roots and are specifically induced by Al exposure, Expression in onion epidermal cells, rice protoplasts, and yeast showed that STAR1 interacts with STAR2 to form a complex that localizes to the vesicle membranes of all root cells, except for those in the epidermal layer of the mature zone, Furthermore, addition of exogenous UDP-glucose rescued root growth in the star1 mutant exposed to Al
3. __Al tolerance__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two genes, STAR1 (for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1) and STAR2, are responsible for Al tolerance in rice
4. __transporter__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  STAR1 encodes a nucleotide binding domain, while STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain, of a bacterial-type ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, These results indicate that STAR1 and STAR2 form a complex that functions as an ABC transporter, which is required for detoxification of Al in rice
5. __growth__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, addition of exogenous UDP-glucose rescued root growth in the star1 mutant exposed to Al
