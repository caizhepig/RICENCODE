## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
2. __yield__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
3. __salinity__, ["SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice"%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia"
4. __growth__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
5. __auxin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia, The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region, Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport,SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice
6. __nitrogen__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
7. __root__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
8. __shoot__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
