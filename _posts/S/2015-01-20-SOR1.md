1. __root__, [Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Segregation analyses by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the soil-surface rooting mutant and wild-type Nipponbare indicated that the trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, designated as sor1, CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sor1, a rice mutant causing soil-surface rooting and altered root gravitropic response, is allelic to Os04g0101800, and that a 33-bp deletion in the coding region of this gene causes the mutant phenotypes
