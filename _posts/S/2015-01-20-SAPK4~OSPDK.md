## Key message
1. __seedling__, [The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Induced expression of SAPK4 resulted in improved germination, growth and development under salt stress both in seedlings and mature plants
