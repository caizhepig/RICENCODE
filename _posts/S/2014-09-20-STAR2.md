## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  STAR1 encodes a nucleotide binding domain, while STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain, of a bacterial-type ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, These results indicate that STAR1 and STAR2 form a complex that functions as an ABC transporter, which is required for detoxification of Al in rice
2. __root__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Both STAR1 and STAR2 are expressed mainly in the roots and are specifically induced by Al exposure, Expression in onion epidermal cells, rice protoplasts, and yeast showed that STAR1 interacts with STAR2 to form a complex that localizes to the vesicle membranes of all root cells, except for those in the epidermal layer of the mature zone
3. __Al tolerance__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two genes, STAR1 (for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1) and STAR2, are responsible for Al tolerance in rice
