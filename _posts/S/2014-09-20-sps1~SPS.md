1. __growth__, [Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy%5BTitle%5D)),  In agreement with this hypothesis, transgenic rice plants with a maize SPS gene that had about 3 times the SPS activity of that in Nipponbare (control plants) were significantly taller than Nipponbare from the early growth stage
2. __phosphate__, [Characterization of a rice sucrose-phosphate synthase-encoding gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice sucrose-phosphate synthase-encoding gene%5BTitle%5D)), A rice genomic clone (sps1) coding for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was isolated and sequenced
3. __phosphate__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D)), The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose
4. __height__, [Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy%5BTitle%5D)),  The higher level of SPS transcripts and the activity of SPS in NIL6 compared to control plants, and the fact that the relative SPS activity per SPS protein content was almost the same between NIL6 and Nipponbare suggested that the higher plant height in NIL6 compared to Nipponbare was due to the high SPS activity in NIL6
5. __leaf__, [Tissue-specific and developmental pattern of expression of the rice sps1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Tissue-specific and developmental pattern of expression of the rice sps1 gene%5BTitle%5D)),  During leaf development, the sps1 promoter directs a basipetal pattern of expression that coincides with the distribution of SPS activity during the leaf sink-to-source transition, It was also found that during the vegetative part of the growth cycle, SPS expression and enzymatic activity are highest in the youngest fully expanded leaf

1. __OsSPS11__, __sps1,SPS__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D)),  To examine whether the promoters of OsSPSs can be controlled by sugars and circadian clock, we produced transgenic rice plants harboring a promoter-luciferase construct for OsSPS1 or OsSPS11 and analyzed the changes in the promoter activities by monitoring bioluminescence from intact transgenic plants in real-time, Under the light-dark cycle, both OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 promoter activities were low in the dark and increased rapidly after the beginning of the light period, When the transgenic rice plants were moved to the continuous light condition, both P OsSPS1 ::LUC and P OsSPS11 ::LUC reporter plants exhibited circadian bioluminescence rhythms; bioluminescence peaked during the subjective day with a 27-h period: in the early morning as for OsSPS1 promoter and midday for OsSPS11 promoter,The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose
