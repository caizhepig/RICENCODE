## Key message
1. __grain__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
2. __seed__, [A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length%5BTitle%5D)), The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (srs3) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene, Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type, The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type, The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction
