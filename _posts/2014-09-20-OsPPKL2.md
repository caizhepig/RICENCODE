## Key message
1. __grain__, [Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator
2. __grain length__, [Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator
