## Key message
1. __shoot__, [The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice
2. __flower__, [Overexpression of a Transcription Factor OsMADS15 Modifies Plant Architecture and Flowering Time in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a Transcription Factor OsMADS15 Modifies Plant Architecture and Flowering Time in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations
3. __growth__, [The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth
4. __auxin__, [The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in WOX11 overexpression and RNA interference transgenic plants, The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development
5. __root__, [The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth, WOX11 was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem, Further analysis showed that WOX11 directly repressed RR2, a type-A cytokinin-responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia, The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development,The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice
6. __crown__, [The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth, WOX11 was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem, Further analysis showed that WOX11 directly repressed RR2, a type-A cytokinin-responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia, The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development,The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice
