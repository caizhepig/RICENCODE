## Connection
1. __CLPP4__, __OsClpP5__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, we found that OsClpP3 directly interacts with OsClpT, that OsClpP4 directly interacts with OsClpP5 and OsClpT, and that both OsClpP4 and OsClpT can homodimerize
2. __CLPP4__, __VYL__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo, In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4
