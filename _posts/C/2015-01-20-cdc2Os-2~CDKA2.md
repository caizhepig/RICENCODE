## Connection
1. __cdc2Os-1~CDKA1__, __cdc2Os-2~CDKA2__, [Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants%5BTitle%5D)), Using probes obtained by PCR amplification, we have isolated two cognate rice cDNAs (cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2) encoding structural homologues of the cdc2+/CDC28 (cdc2) protein kinase from a cDNA library prepared from cultured rice cells, Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2 showed that they are 83% identical, Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome
2. __cdc2Os-2~CDKA2__, __R2__, [Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants%5BTitle%5D)),  Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome, However, despite the similarity in structure, both cdc2Os-2 and R2 were unable to complement the same mutant
