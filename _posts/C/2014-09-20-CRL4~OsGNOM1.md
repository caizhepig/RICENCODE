## Key message
1. __anther__, [Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR and analysis of promoter::GUS transgenic plants showed that OsGNOM1 is expressed in AR primordia, vascular tissues, LRs, root tips, leaves, anthers and lemma veins, with a distribution pattern similar to that of auxin
2. __crown root__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)), ) mutant crown rootless4 (crl4) that was found to have defective crown root formation, Besides reduced crown root number, the crl4 mutant showed auxin-related abnormal phenotypical character-istics such as reduced lateral root number and impaired root gravitropism, These results indicate that maintaining an appropriate auxin accumulation and gradient through CRL4 in the basal portion of shoots is essential for crown root formation in rice,CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice
3. __lemma__, [Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR and analysis of promoter::GUS transgenic plants showed that OsGNOM1 is expressed in AR primordia, vascular tissues, LRs, root tips, leaves, anthers and lemma veins, with a distribution pattern similar to that of auxin
4. __auxin__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Besides reduced crown root number, the crl4 mutant showed auxin-related abnormal phenotypical character-istics such as reduced lateral root number and impaired root gravitropism, CRL4 encodes a protein highly homologous with Arabidopsis GNOM, which mediates auxin-dependent plant growth by coordinating the polar localization of auxin efflux carrier PIN1, In the crl4 mutant, auxin transport was impaired in shoots and roots, These results indicate that maintaining an appropriate auxin accumulation and gradient through CRL4 in the basal portion of shoots is essential for crown root formation in rice,CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice

6. __shoot__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the crl4 mutant, auxin transport was impaired in shoots and roots, These results indicate that maintaining an appropriate auxin accumulation and gradient through CRL4 in the basal portion of shoots is essential for crown root formation in rice
