## Key message
1. __disease__, [Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis
2. __disease resistance__, [Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis
