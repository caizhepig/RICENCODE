## Key message
1. __flower__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway, Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots
2. __reproductive__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
3. __reproductive__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood,Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
4. __panicle__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles, These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles
5. __inflorescence__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
6. __vegetative__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots,The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
7. __ ga __, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Double mutant (d18-k pps-1) showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes
8. __growth__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)), Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
9. __leaf__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type
10. __meristem__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
11. __ ga __, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant
12. __flowering time__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood

14. __flower__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)), The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering, Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood
15. __vegetative__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood, These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles,Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
