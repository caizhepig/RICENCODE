2. __brassinosteroid__, [Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro%5BTitle%5D)),  We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: CYP90D2 and CYP90D3, However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies, These results indicate that CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice,Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro
