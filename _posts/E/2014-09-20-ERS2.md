## Key message
1. __iaa__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene
2. __ethylene__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D)), Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice, Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species, However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene, Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice
