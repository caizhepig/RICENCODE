## Key message
1. __fertility__, [Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82
