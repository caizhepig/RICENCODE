## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The eIF-1 over-expressing lines showed improved growth under salt stress that was correlated with maintenance of photosynthetic activity and reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation in leaves
2. __salt__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " In a search for novel molecular mechanisms involved in salt acclimation, transcript analyses revealed increased expression of a SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 in the salt-tolerant grass species Festuca rubra ssp, To further examine the role of eIF-1 in salt tolerance, transgenic rice plants were generated that over-express this factor under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter, The eIF-1 over-expressing lines showed improved growth under salt stress that was correlated with maintenance of photosynthetic activity and reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation in leaves, Our data suggest that eIF-1 has a central function in salt-stress adaptation in rice by regulating ion accumulation and the intracellular redox status"
3. __leaf__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Upon analysis of the cell specificity of eIF-1 transcription by in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR), predominant signals were detected in rice leaf mesophyll
4. __salt tolerance__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " To further examine the role of eIF-1 in salt tolerance, transgenic rice plants were generated that over-express this factor under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter"
5. __homeostasis__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice
6. __growth__, [The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The eIF-1 over-expressing lines showed improved growth under salt stress that was correlated with maintenance of photosynthetic activity and reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation in leaves
