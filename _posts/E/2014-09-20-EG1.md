## Key message
1. __floral meristem__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy, We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
2. __meristem__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy, We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
3. __spikelet__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development
4. __floral__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy, In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in EG1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls, EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia, We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
5. __inflorescence__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia
6. __JA biosynthesis__, [Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1¡¯s degradation during spikelet development
