## Key message
1. __transporter__, [OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter%5BTitle%5D)), Using a degenerative probe designed according to the most conservative region of a known Lys- and His-specific amino acid transporter (LHT1) from Arabidopsis, we isolated a full-length cDNA named OsHT (histidine transporter of Oryza sativa L, Multiple sequence alignments showed that OsHT shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters, Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that OsHT was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that OsHT is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice,OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter
