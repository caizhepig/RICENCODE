## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Identification of three shikimate kinase genes in rice: characterization of their differential expression during panicle development and of the enzymatic activities of the encoded proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of three shikimate kinase genes in rice: characterization of their differential expression during panicle development and of the enzymatic activities of the encoded proteins%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsSK1 and OsSK2 was induced in rice calli by treatment with the elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose, and that expression of OsSK1 and OsSK3 was up-regulated specifically during the heading stage of panicle development

## Connection
