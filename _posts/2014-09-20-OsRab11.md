## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
3. __defense__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8"

## Connection
1. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11, Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included, OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments, In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8
2. __OsGAP1__, __OsRab11__, [OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGAP1 strongly stimulated OsRab8a and OsRab11, which are homologs of the mammalian Rab8 and Rab11 proteins that are essential for Golgi to plasma membrane (PM) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to PM trafficking, respectively, sativa dissociation inhibitor 3 (OsGDI3)-catalyzed OsRab11 recycling at an early stage, but the OsGAP1(R385A) and (R450A) mutants do not, Surprisingly, OsRab11 overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the OsGAP1 mutants on vesicular trafficking, Thus, the OsGAP1 mutants may inhibit TGN to PM or central vacuole trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous Rab11, We propose that OsGAP1 facilitates vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the PM or central vacuole by both stimulating the GTPase activity of OsRab11 and increasing the recycling of inactive OsRab11,OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking
