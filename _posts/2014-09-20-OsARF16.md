## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  In -Pi conditions, the shoot biomass of osarf16 was slightly reduced, and neither root growth nor iron content was induced, indicating that the knockout of OsARF16 led to loss of response to Pi deficiency in rice
2. __phosphate__, [OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi,OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
3. __auxin__, [OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that OsARF16, an auxin response factor, functions in both auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L, The knockout of OsARF16 led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and -Pi response, These data first reveal the biological function of OsARF16, provide novel evidence of a linkage between auxin and -Pi responses and facilitate the development of new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi in rice,OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
