## Key message
1. __blast disease__, [Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the OsSGT1 gene significantly reduced the probenazole-dependent development of resistance against blast disease, further supporting the suggestion that OsSGT1 is a key mediator of development of chemically induced disease resistance
2. __salicylic acid__, [Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)), Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants
