## Key message
1. __bacterial blight__, [Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H(2)O(2) generation,Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice
2. __disease__, [Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice
3. __blight__, [Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H(2)O(2) generation,Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice
4. __ xoo __, [Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage, We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice
5. __disease resistance__, [Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice
