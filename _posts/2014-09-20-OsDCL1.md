## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants that expressed inverted repeats of OsDCL1 resulted in developmental arrest at the seedling stage, and weak loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants caused pleiotropic developmental defects
