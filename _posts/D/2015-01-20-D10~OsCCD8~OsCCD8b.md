## Key message
1. __tillering__, [The interactions among DWARF10, auxin and cytokinin underlie lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interactions among DWARF10, auxin and cytokinin underlie lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Besides, in D10-RNAi plants, decreased storage cytokinin levels in the shoot node may partly account for the increased active cytokinin contents, resulting in more tillering phenotypes
2. __auxin__, [DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of D10 mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin
3. __shoot__, [DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  D10 is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching
4. __growth__, [A new lead chemical for strigolactone biosynthesis inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A new lead chemical for strigolactone biosynthesis inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  We discovered a triazole-type chemical, TIS13 [2,2-dimethyl-7-phenoxy-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)heptan-3-ol], which induced outgrowth of second tiller buds of wild-type seedlings, as observed for non-treated strigolactone-deficient d10 mutant seedlings
5. __tiller__, [DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1)
6. __auxin__, [The interactions among DWARF10, auxin and cytokinin underlie lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interactions among DWARF10, auxin and cytokinin underlie lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we use D10- RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants similar to d10 mutant in phenotypes to investigate the interactions among D10, auxin and cytokinin in regulating rice shoot branching, Auxin levels in node 1 of both decapitated D10-RNAi and wild type plants decreased significantly, showing that decapitation does reduce endogenous auxin concentration, but decapitation has no clear effects on auxin levels in node 2 of the same plants, This implies that node 1 may be the location where a possible interaction between auxin and D10 gene would be detected, D10 expression in node 1 is inhibited by decapitation, and this inhibition can be restored by exogenous auxin application, indicating that D10 may play an important role in auxin regulation of SL, The decreased expression of most OsPINs in shoot nodes of D10-RNAi plants may cause a reduced auxin transport capacity, Furthermore, effects of auxin treatment of decapitated plants on the expression of cytokinin biosynthetic genes suggest that D10 promotes cytokinin biosynthesis by reducing auxin levels
7. __meristem__, [DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In dwarf10 (d10), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced
8. __shoot__, [d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers%5BTitle%5D)),  The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants d10 and d3, respectively
9. __branching__, [d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers%5BTitle%5D)),  However, unlike with d10, the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones
10. __strigolactone__, [Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway
11. __cell death__, [Rice tillering dwarf mutant dwarf3 has increased leaf longevity during darkness-induced senescence or hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice tillering dwarf mutant dwarf3 has increased leaf longevity during darkness-induced senescence or hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, the mRNA levels of D3, HTD1 and D10, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9, MAX3 and MAX4, respectively, increased during cell death
12. __dwarf__, [DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In dwarf10 (d10), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced, Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1)
