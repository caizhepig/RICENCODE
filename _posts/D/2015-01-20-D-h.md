## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice
2. __panicle__, [Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and promoter activity assays showed that the d-h gene was primarily expressed in the nodes and the panicle
3. __ ga __, [Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Since the mutant plants exhibit a defect in GA response, but not in the GA synthetic pathway, it appears that the d-h gene may be involved in a GA signaling pathway
