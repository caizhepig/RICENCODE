## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D)),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
2. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 (Docs1), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots, Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots, Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers, Immunostaining with an anti-Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region, These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice
3. __flower__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D)),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
4. __primary root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D)),  Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots
5. __sheath__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D)),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
