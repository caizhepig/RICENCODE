## Expression information

## Key message
1. __panicle__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages
2. __oxidative__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the dsm1 mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity"
3. __seedling__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages, Overexpression of DSM1 in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage
4. __drought resistance__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice
5. __salt__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold"
6. __drought__, [A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " We identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant (drought-hypersensitive mutant1 [dsm1]) of a putative MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) gene in rice (Oryza sativa), Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages, The dsm1 mutants lost water more rapidly than wild-type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought-sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants, DSM1-RNA interference lines were also hypersensitive to drought stress, By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold, Together, these results suggest that DSM1 might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice,A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice"
