## Connection
1. __OsMYBS1__, __SnRK1B__, [The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters
2. __SnRK1A__, __SnRK1B__, [The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters, Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied
