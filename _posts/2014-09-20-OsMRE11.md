## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
2. __meiotic__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation, We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
3. __seed__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
4. __growth__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
5. __vegetative__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
