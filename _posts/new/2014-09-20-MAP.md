[Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2011, BMC Genomics.

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
2. __shoot__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
3. __auxin__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified, Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
4. __transcription factor__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
