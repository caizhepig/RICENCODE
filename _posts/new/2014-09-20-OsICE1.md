## Publication
1. [Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation%5BTitle%5D)), 2011, Plant Biotechnology.

## Genbank accession number

## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation%5BTitle%5D)), " In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2"

## Connection
1. __OsbHLH001~OsICE2__, __OsICE1__, [Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation%5BTitle%5D)),  These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively, In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2
