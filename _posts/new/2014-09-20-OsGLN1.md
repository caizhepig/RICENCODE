## Key message
1. __drought__, ["Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)"%5BTitle%5D)), " Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsGLN1 is up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and the accumulation of OsGLN1 transcript is more in the roots of rice seedlings, These results clearly indicated that the endo-1,3-β-glucanase encoded by OsGLN1 plays an important role associated with plant defence against abiotic and biotic stresses particularly for drought and fungal pathogen in rice seedlings"
