3. __leaf__, [Rice OsGL1-6 Is Involved in Leaf Cuticular Wax Accumulation and Drought Resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OsGL1-6 Is Involved in Leaf Cuticular Wax Accumulation and Drought Resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  These OsGL1-6 antisense-RNA transgenic plants showed droopy leaves at the booting stage, significantly decreased leaf cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticle membrane, increased chlorophyll leaching and water loss rates, and enhanced drought sensitivity, The OsGL1-6 gene was constitutively expressed in all examined organs and was very highly expressed in leaf epidermal cells and vascular bundles, Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the wax composition using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a significantly reduced total cuticular wax load on the leaf blades of the OsGL1-6 antisense-RNA transgenic plants as well as markedly decreased alkane and aldehyde contents, We propose that OsGL1-6 is involved in the accumulation of leaf cuticular wax and directly impacts drought resistance in rice,Rice OsGL1-6 Is Involved in Leaf Cuticular Wax Accumulation and Drought Resistance
