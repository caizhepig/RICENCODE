## Key message
1. __stomata__, [OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in tobacco increased sensitivity to drought stress and insensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening
2. __drought__, ["OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants"%5BTitle%5D)), " Quantitative real-time PCR and GENEVESTIGATOR analysis showed that OsPFA-DSP1 mRNA was induced by drought stress, Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in tobacco increased sensitivity to drought stress and insensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening, Furthermore, overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in rice also increased sensitivity to drought stress, These results indicated that OsPFA-DSP1 is a functional PTP and may act as a negative regulator in drought stress responses,OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants"
3. __stomatal__, [OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in tobacco increased sensitivity to drought stress and insensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening
