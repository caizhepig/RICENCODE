## Key message
1. __starch__, [Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Starch synthase IIa (SsIIa) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation, To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in rice, we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated rice and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon

3. __grain__, [Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of rice grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of tropical japonica rice
