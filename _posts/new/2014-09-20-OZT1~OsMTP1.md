## Key message
1. __homeostasis__, [Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, OZT1 is a CDF family vacuolar zinc transporter conferring tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress, which is important to transporting and homeostasis of Zn, Cd or other heavy metals in plants
2. __transporter__, [Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals, and maintain ion homeostasis in plant
3. __Al tolerance__, [Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMTP1 is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)/metal tolerance protein (MTP) family of metal cation transporters in Oryza sativa, which is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MTP1
4. __homeostasis__, [Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals, and maintain ion homeostasis in plant
5. __growth__, [Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMTP1 alleviated, to some extent, the Co sensitivity of this mutant, rescued the Fe hypersensitivity of the ccc1 mutant at low Fe concentrations, and restored growth of the Cd-hypersensitive mutant ycf1 at low Cd concentrations
6. __seedling__, [Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The OZT1 expression was significantly induced both in the seedlings of japonica rice Nipponbare and indica rice IR26 in response to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) treatments
7. __growth__, [Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMTP1 expression increased tolerance to Zn, Cd, and Ni in wild-type yeast BY4741 during the exponential growth phase
8. __seedling__, [Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMTP1 dsRNAi mediated by transgenic assay in rice seedlings resulted in heavy metal sensitivity and changed the heavy metal accumulation in different organs of mature rice under low-concentration heavy metal stress
9. __transporter__, [Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  In this research, a full length cDNA named Oryza sativa Zn Transporter 1 (OZT1) that closely related to rat ZnT-2 (Zn Transporter 2) gene was isolated from rice, Together, OZT1 is a CDF family vacuolar zinc transporter conferring tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress, which is important to transporting and homeostasis of Zn, Cd or other heavy metals in plants,Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
