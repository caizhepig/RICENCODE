## Key message
1. __sterile__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype
2. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I, OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
3. __meiosis__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis,The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis
4. __panicle__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles
5. __sterility__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
6. __vegetative__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
7. __growth__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility

## Connection
1. __HEI10__, __OsMSH5__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
2. __MER3~RCK__, __OsMSH5__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
3. __OsMSH5__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
