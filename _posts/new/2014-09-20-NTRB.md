## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
2. __chloroplast__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR
3. __shoot__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
4. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
5. __mitochondria__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR

## Connection
1. __NTRA__, __NTRB__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR, In the present study, we describe isolation and cloning of two cDNAs encoding OsNTRA and OsNTRB, OsNTRB and OsNTRA exhibited almost similar in vitro activities, OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
