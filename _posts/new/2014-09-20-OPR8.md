## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
3. __defense__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8"

## Connection
1. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11, Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included, OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments, In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8
