## Key message
1. __root__, [RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis using an OsXIP-specific antibody revealed that OsXIP is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding
2. __root__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root
3. __defense__, ["RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  These results reinforced the possibility that OsXIP is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens
4. __jasmonate__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root
5. __grain__, [RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the OsXIP gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant OsXIP had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and OsXIP-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of OsXIP,RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice
