## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while OsSPS2 localized to plastids, This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas OsSPS2 is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation
2. __growth__, [Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas OsSPS2 only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant
3. __root__, [Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas OsSPS2 was found to be high in both leaves and roots
