2. __salt stress__, [Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA"

## Connection
1. __OsNHX2~OsNHX3__, __OsNHX5__, [Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes, OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration, The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
