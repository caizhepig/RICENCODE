## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsTPKa__, __OsTPKb__, [Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles%5BTitle%5D)),  The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed, In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments, Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not, The use of TPKa:TPKb chimeras showed that C-terminal domains are crucial for the differential targeting of TPKa and TPKb, Site-directed mutagenesis of C-terminal residues that were different between TPKa and TPKb identified three amino acids that are important in determining ultimate vacuolar destination
