## Key message

## Connection
1. __Pikp-1__, __Pikp-2__, [The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Both Pikp-1 (KP3) and Pikp-2 (KP4) encode coiled-coil NBS-LRR proteins and share, respectively, 95 and 99% peptide identity with the two alleles, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS, The Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 sequences share only limited homology, Both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 were constitutively expressed in cv
