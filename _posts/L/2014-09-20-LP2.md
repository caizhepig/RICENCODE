## Key message
1. __reproductive__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues
2. __seed__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues, The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings
3. __panicle__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240)
4. __seedling__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings
5. __root__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues
6. __leaf__, [The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240)
