## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsCAO1__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes, These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark
