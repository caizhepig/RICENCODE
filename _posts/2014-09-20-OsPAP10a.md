## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation, Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts
2. __root__, [Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation, Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts, In vivo root 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) assays and activity measurements on external media showed that OsPAP10a is a root-associated APase,Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice
3. __transcription factor__, [Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis
4. __homeostasis__, [Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis
5. __breeding__, [Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsPAP10a can potentially be used for crop breeding to improve the efficiency of P use
