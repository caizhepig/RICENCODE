4. __large lamina joint angles__, [The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes%5BTitle%5D)), FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, 
5. __IAA__, [The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes%5BTitle%5D)), FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels.
6. __IAA biosynthesis__, [The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes%5BTitle%5D)), FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels.
