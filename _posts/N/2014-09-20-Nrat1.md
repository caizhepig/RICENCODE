## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice, We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles
2. __root__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells, Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
3. __manganese__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex
4. __transcription factor__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
5. __iron__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex
6. __aluminum__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice
7. __cell wall__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals
8. __cadmium__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex

## Connection
1. __ART1__, __Nrat1__, [Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
