## Key message
1. __growth__, [Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited
2. __seedling__, [Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa.

3. __salt__, [Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses, These results suggest that NADP-ME2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress
4. __root__, [Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of NADP-ME2 mRNA in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3, NaCl, and environmental pH changes
