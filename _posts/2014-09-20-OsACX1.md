## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
3. __seed__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds, It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
4. __stem__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds, Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically
5. __root__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds

## Connection
1. __OsACX1__, __OsACX3__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively
2. __OsACX1__, __OsACX2__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D)),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively, It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
